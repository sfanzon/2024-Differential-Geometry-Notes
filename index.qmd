# Welcome {.unnumbered}

These are the Lecture Notes of **Differential Geometry 661955** for T1 2023/24 at the University of Hull. We will study curves and surfaces in $\R^3$. I will follow these lecture notes during the course. 
If you have any question or find any typo, please email me at

## Readings {.unnumbered}

Main textbooks:

- Pressley [@pressley] for differential geometry,
- Manetti [@manetti] for general topology.

Other interesting readings are the books by do Carmo [@do-carmo] 
and Abate, Tovena [@abate-tovena]. I will assume some knowledge from Analysis 
and Linear Algebra. A good place to revise these topics are 
the books by Zorich [@zorich-1; @zorich-2]. 



## Visualization {.unnumbered} 

It is important to visualize the geometrical objects and concepts 
we are going to talk about in this course. I will show basic Python 
code to plot curves and surfaces. This part of the course is 
**`not required`** for the final examination. If you want to 
have fun plotting with Pyhton, I recommend installation through 
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). 
The actual coding can then be done through 
[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org). Good references for scientific 
Python programming are [@johansson;@KSB-Python].   
If you do not want to mess around with Python, you can still visualize 
pretty much everything we will do in this course using the excellent 
online 3D grapher tool [CalcPlot3D](https://c3d.libretexts.org/CalcPlot3D/index.html/). 
To understand how it works, please refer to the [help manual](https://c3d.libretexts.org/CalcPlot3D/CalcPlot3D-Help/front.html) 
or to the short [video introduction](https://c3d.libretexts.org/CalcPlot3D/CalcPlot3D-Help/section-1.html). Another nice tool is [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com).
