# Curvature and Torsion

We have seen how to describe curves and reparametrized them. Now we want to look at local properties of curves:

- How much does a curve twist?
- How much does a curve bend?

We will measure two quantities:

- **Curvature**: measures how much a curve $\g$ deviates from a straight line.
- **Torsion**: measures how much a curve $\g$ deviates from a plane.

For example a 2D spiral is curved, but still lies in a plane. Instead the Helix both deviates from a straight line and *pulls away* from any fixed plane. 



## Curvature 

We start with an informal discussion. Suppose $\g$ is a straight line
$$
\g(t) = \mathbf{a} + t \mathbf{v}
$$
with $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{v} \in \R^3$. Whichever the definition of curvature will be,
we expect the curvature of a straight line to be zero. The tangent vector to $\g$ is constant
$$
\dg(t) =  \mathbf{v} \,.
$$
If we further derive the tangent vector, we obtain
$$
\ddg(t) =  \zero \,.
$$
Thus $\ddg$ seems to be a good candidate for the definition of curvature of $\g$ at the point $\g(t)$.  


Suppose now that $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^2$ is a **planar curve** with unit-speed. We have proven that in this case
$$
\dg \cdot \ddg = 0 \,,
$$
that is, the vector $\ddg$ is orthogonal to the tangent $\dg$ at all times. Now let $\mathbf{n}(t)$ be the unit vector orthogonal to $\dg(t)$ at the point $\g(t)$. The amount that the curve $\g$ deviates from its tangent at $\g(t)$ after time $t_0$ is
$$
[ \g(t + t_0) - \g(t) ] \cdot \mathbf{n}(t) \,,
$$ {#eq-curvature-heuristics}
as seen in Figure @fig-curvature.


![Amount that $\g$ deviates from tangent is $[\g(t+t_0)-\g(t)] \cdot \nn(t)$](/images/curvature.png){#fig-curvature width=70%}


Equation (@eq-curvature-heuristics) is what we take as measure of curvature. Since 
$$
\dg(t) \cdot \ddg(t) = 0 \quad \mbox{ and } \quad   \dg(t) \cdot \mathbf{n}(t)= 0 \,,
$$
we conclude that $\ddg(s)$ is parallel to $\mathbf{n}(t)$. Since $\mathbf{n}(t)$ is a unit vector, there exists a scalar $\kappa(t)$ such that 
$$
\ddg(t)  = \kappa(t) \, \mathbf{n}(t) \,.
$$
Taking the norms of the above and recalling that $\norm{\nn} = 1$ gives
$$
\kappa(t) = \norm{ \ddg(t) }
$$
Now, approximate $\g$ at $t$ with its second order Taylor polynomial:
$$
\g(t+t_0) = \g(t) + \dg(t) t_0 + \frac{\ddg(t)}{2} t_0^2 + o(t_0^2)
$$
where the remainder $o(t_0^2)$ is such that 
$$
\lim_{t_0 \to 0} \ \frac{o(t_0^2)}{t_0^2} = 0 \,.
$$
Therefore, discarding the remainder, 
$$
\g(t+t_0) - \g(t) \approx \dg(t) t_0 + \frac{\ddg(t)}{2} t_0^2 \,.
$$
Multiplying by $\nn(t)$ we get
$$
(\g(t+t_0) - \g(t)) \cdot \nn(t) \approx \dg(t) \cdot \nn(t) t_0 + 
\frac{\ddg(t) \cdot \nn(t) }{2} t_0^2\,.
$$
Recalling that 
$$
\dg(t) \cdot \nn(t) = 0\,, \quad  \ddg(t) \cdot \nn(t) = \kappa(t) \,, 
$$
we then obtain
$$
[\g(t + t_0) - \g(t) ] \cdot \nn(t) \approx 
\frac{1}{2} \, \kappa(t) \, t_0^2
$$


::: Important

The amount that $\g$ deviates from a straight line is proportional to 
$$
\kappa(t) = \norm{\ddg (t)}\,.
$$

:::

We take this as definition of curvature for a general unit-speed curve in $\R^n$.


::: Definition 
### Curvature of unit-speed curve

Let $\g \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^n$ be a unit-speed curve. The **curvature** of $\g$ at $\g(t)$ is
$$
\kappa(t) := \norm{\ddg (t)} \,.
$$

:::



Note that $\kappa(t)$ is a function of the parameter $t$: The curvature of $\g$ can change from point to point.



::: Example
### Curvature of the circle

We have seen that the arc-length parametrization of the circle of center
$(x_0,y_0)$ and radius $R>0$ is
$$
\g(t) =  \left( x_0 + R \cos \left( \frac{t}{R} \right), y_0 + \sin \left( \frac{t}{R} \right) \right) 
$$
As $\g$ is parametrized by arc-length, we have that $\g$ is unit-speed.
To compute the curvature we need the second derivative $\ddg$
\begin{align*}
\dg (t) & =  \left( - \sin \left( \frac{t}{R} \right) ,  \cos \left( \frac{t}{R} \right)\right) \\
\ddg (t) & =  \left( -\frac{1}{R} \cos \left( \frac{t}{R} \right) ,  - \frac{1}{R} \sin \left( \frac{t}{R} \right)\right)
\end{align*}
Therefore the curvature of $\g$ is
$$
\kappa(t) = \norm{ \ddg (t) } = \frac{1}{R} \,.
$$
In this case $\kappa$ is constant. The above formula also tells us that
the curvature is inversely proportional to the radius of the circle: A large circle will look (locally) almost like a straight line.

:::



**Question:** How do we define curvature for arbitrary curves?

**Answer:** When $\g$ is regular we can use unit-speed reparametrizations to define $\kappa$.



::: Definition 
### Curvature of regular curve {#definition-curvature}

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be a regular curve and $\tg$ be a unit-speed reparametrization of 
$\g$, with 
$$
\g = \tg \circ \phi \,,  \quad \f \colon  (a,b) \to (\tilde{a},\tilde{b})  \,.
$$
Denote by
$$
\tilde{\kappa} \colon (\tilde{a},\tilde{b}) \to \R \,, \qquad \tilde{\kappa}(t) :=   \norm{\ddtg (t)}
$$
the curvature of $\tg$. The **curvature** of $\g$ at $\g(t)$ is defined by
$$
\kappa(t) := \tilde{\kappa}(\f(t))
$$

:::

In order for the above definition to make sense, 
we need to check that the curvature $\kappa$ does not change if we choose a different unit-speed reparametrization.
This is shown in the next Proposition. 


::: Proposition
### $\kappa$ is invariant for unit-speed reparametrization {#proposition-curvature-invariant}

Consider the setting of Definition \ref{definition-curvature}.
If $\hat{\g}$ is another unit-speed reparametrization of $\g$, with $\g = \hat{\g} \circ \psi$, then
$$
\kappa(t) = \tilde{\kappa} ( \f(t) ) = \hat{\kappa}(\psi(t)) \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b)
$$
where 
$$
\hat{\kappa}(t) := \norm{ \ddot{\hat{ \g }}(t) }
$$
is the curvature of $\hat{\g}$. 

:::


::: Proof
Since $\tg$ and $\hat{\g}$ are both reparametrizations of $\g$
$$
\tg(  \f(t)) = \g(t) = \hat{\g} (\psi(t)  ) 
$$
Using that $\f$ is invertible we obtain
$$
{\tg}(t) = \hat\g(\xi(t))\,, \quad \xi := \psi \circ \f^{-1} \,,
$${#eq-well-posed-curvature-3}
and $\xi$ is a diffeomorphism, being composition of diffeomorphisms. 
Differentiating (@eq-well-posed-curvature-3)
$$
\dtg(t) = \dot{\hat{\g}}(\xi(t)) \dot\xi(t) \,.
$${#eq-well-posed-curvature-2}
Taking the norms and recalling that $\tg$ and $\hat\g$ are unit-speed, we get
$$
|\dot\xi(t)| = 1 \,, \quad  \forall \, t \,. 
$$
Since $\dot\xi$ is continuous we infer 
$$
\dot\xi(t) \equiv 1 \quad \mbox{or} \quad
\dot\xi(t) \equiv -1 \,.
$$
In both cases
$$
\ddot \xi \equiv 0 \,.
$$
Differentiating (@eq-well-posed-curvature-2) we then obtain
\begin{align*}
\ddtg(t) & = \ddot{\hat{\g}}(\xi(t)) \dot\xi^2(t) + 
                         \dot{\hat{\g}}(\xi(t)) \ddot\xi (t) \\
                  & = \ddot{\hat{\g}}(\xi(t)) \dot\xi^2(t) \,,
\end{align*}
where we used that $\ddot{\xi} = 0$.
Taking the norms and using again that $|\dot\xi| \equiv 1$ 
$$
\norm{  \ddtg(t)} = \norm{ \ddot{\hat{\g}}(\xi(t))} \,.
$$
Recalling that $\xi  = \psi \circ \f^{-1}$ and the definitions of $\tilde{\kappa}$ and $\hat{\kappa}$ we conclude
$$
\tilde{\kappa} ( \f(t) ) = \norm{  \ddtg( \f(t))} = \norm{ \ddot{\hat{\g}}(\psi(t))} = \hat{\kappa} ( \psi(t) ) \,.
$$

::: Remark 
### Method for computing curvature

In summary, the curvature of a regular curve 
$$
\g \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^n
$$ 
is defined via unit-speed reparametrizations of $\g$. To compute $\kappa$ we do the following: 

1. Find a unit-speed reparametrization $\tg$ of the regular curve $\g$

2. This can be done by computing $s$ the arc-length of $\g$, and then defining the arc-length reparametrization
$$
\tg:= \g \circ s^{-1}
$$

3. Compute curvature of $\tg$
$$
\tilde{\kappa}(s) = \norm{\ddtg (s)}
$$

4. The curvature of $\g$ at $\g(t)$ is
$$
\kappa (t)= \tilde{\kappa} (s(t)) 
$$

:::


::: Important

When $\g$ is regular and has values in $\R^3$, there is a way to compute $\kappa$ without reparametrizing. To see this, we will first need the notion of **cross product**, or **vector product**.

:::




Before proceeding with the next example, let us give a short overview of the **Hyperbolic functions**.
 

::: Remark 
### Hyperbolic functions    {#remark-hyperbolic-functions}

The Hyperbloic functions are the analogous of the trigonometric functions, but defined using the hyperbola rather than the circle. Their formulas can be obtained by means of the exponential function $e^t$. We have:


- Hyperbolic cosine: The **even part** of the function $e^t$, that is, 
$$
\cosh (t) = \frac {e^t + e^{-t}} {2} = \frac {e^{2t} + 1} {2e^t} = \frac {1 + e^{-2t}} {2e^{-t}} \,.
$$

- Hyperbolic sine: The **odd part** of the function $e^t$, that is, 
$$
\sinh (t) = \frac {e^t - e^{-t}} {2} = \frac {e^{2t} - 1} {2e^t} = \frac {1 - e^{-2t}} {2e^{-t}} \,.
$$

- Hyperbolic tangent: Defined by
$$
\tanh(t) = \frac{\sinh t}{\cosh t} = \frac {e^t - e^{-t}} {e^t + e^{-t}}
= \frac{e^{2t} - 1} {e^{2t} + 1} \,.
$$

- Hyperbolic cotangent: The reciprocal of $\tanh$ for $t \neq 0$,
$$
\coth t = \frac{\cosh t}{\sinh t} = \frac {e^t + e^{-t}} {e^t - e^{-t}}
= \frac{e^{2t} + 1} {e^{2t} - 1} \,.
$$

- Hyperbolic secant: The reciprocal of $\cosh$
$$
\sech (t) = \frac{1}{\cosh t} = \frac {2} {e^t + e^{-t}}
= \frac{2e^t} {e^{2t} + 1} \,.
$$

* Hyperbolic cosecant: The reciprocal of $\sinh$ for $t \neq 0$,
$$
\csch (t) = \frac{1}{\sinh t} = \frac {2} {e^t - e^{-t}}
= \frac{2e^t} {e^{2t} - 1} \,.
$$

For a plot $\cosh, \sinh, \tanh$ see @fig-hyperbolic-functions below. The properties of the
hyperbolic functions which are of interest to us are:

1. Identities: 
\begin{align*}
&\cosh(t) + \sinh(t) = e^t \\
&\cosh(t) - \sinh(t) = e^{-t} \\
&\cosh^2(t) - \sinh^2(t)  = 1 \\
&{\sech}^2(t) - \tanh^2(t)  = 1  
\end{align*}

2. Derivatives: 
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dt} \left[ \sinh(t) \right] & = \cosh (t) \\
\frac{d}{dt} \left[ \cosh(t) \right] & = \sinh (t) \\
\frac{d}{dt} \left[ \tanh(t) \right] & = 1 - \tanh^2 (t) = - {\csch}^2(t) 
\end{align*}

3. Integrals: 
\begin{align*}
\int_{t_0}^t \sinh(u) \, du & = \cosh (t) - \cosh( t_0 ) \\
\int_{t_0}^t \cosh(u) \, du & = \sinh (t) - \sinh( t_0 ) \\
\int_{t_0}^t \tanh(u) \, du & = \log ( \cosh (t) ) - \log ( \cosh (t_0) )
\end{align*}

::: Example
### The Catenary

The **catenary** is the shape of a heavy chain suspended at its ends. The chain is only subjected to gravity, see @fig-catenary. This shape looks similar to a parabola, but it is not a parabola. This was first noted by Galilei, see this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenary). The profile of the hanging chain can be obtained via a minimization problem, and one can show it is of the form 
$$
\g(t) = ( t, \cosh(t) ) \,, \quad t \in \R \,.
$$
See @fig-catenary-plot for a plot of $\g$. Let us check if $\g$ is regular. We have
$$
\dg (t) = (1 , \sinh(t)) 
$$
so that
$$
\norm{ \dg }^2 = 1 + {\sinh}^2 (t) = \cosh^2 (t) 
\quad \implies \quad
\norm{ \dg } = \cosh (t) \,. 
$$
Note that 
$$
\cosh(t) \geq 1
$$
showing that $\g$ is regular. However
$$
\norm{\dg(1)} = \cosh (1) = \frac{e + e^{-1}}{2} \approx 1.54 \,, 
$$
proving that $\g$ is not unit-speed. Let us then compute the arc-length of $\g$ starting at $t_0 = 0$
$$
s(t) = \int_0^t \norm{ \dg (u) } \, du =  \int_0^t \cosh (u) \, du = \sinh (t)
$$
where we used that $\sinh(0) = 0$. We need to invert $s$. We have
\begin{align*}
s = \sinh(t) \quad & \iff \quad s = \frac{e^t - e^{-t}}{2} \\
             \quad & \iff \quad e^{2t} - 2s e^{t} - 1 = 0\,,
\end{align*}
where the last equation was obtained by rearranging and multiplying both sides by $e^t$. Now we substitute
$$
y = e^t
$$
and obtain
\begin{align*}
e^{2t} - 2s e^{t} - 1 = 0 \quad & \iff \quad y^{2} - 2s y - 1 = 0 \\
                           \quad & \iff \quad y_{\pm} = s \pm \sqrt{1+s^2} \,.
\end{align*}
Notice that
$$
y_{+} = s + \sqrt{1 + s^2} \geq s + \sqrt{s^2} = s + |s| \geq 0
$$
by definition of absolute value. As we were looking for $y$ in the form $y=e^t$, we only consider the positive solution $y_+$. Then
$$
e^t = y_+ = s + \sqrt{1 + s^2 } \quad \implies \quad t = \log \left( s + \sqrt{1 + s^2} \right) \,.
$$
We have proven that the inverse of the arc-length $s(t)$ is 
$$
\psi(s) = t(s) = \log \left( s + \sqrt{ 1+ s^2} \right) \,.
$$
Therefore the arc-length reparametrization of $\g$ is
$$
\tg (s) := \g( t(s) ) = \left(  \log \left( s + \sqrt{ 1+ s^2} \right) , \sqrt{1 + s^2}  \right) \,.
$$
We can now compute the curvature. We have:
\begin{align*}
\dtg (s) &  = \left(  \frac{1}{ \sqrt{1 + s^2} } , \frac{s}{ \sqrt{1 + s^2}}   \right) \\
\ddtg (s) & = \left( - \frac{s}{ (1 + s^2)^{3/2} } , \frac{1}{(1 + s^2)^{3/2} }   \right)
\end{align*}
Hence
$$
\norm{\ddtg (s)}^2 = \frac{s^2}{(1+s^2)^3} + \frac{1}{(1+s^2)^3} = \frac{1}{(1+s^2)^2} \,.
$$
Therefore the curvature of $\tg$ is
$$
\tilde{\kappa}(s) = \norm{\ddtg (s)}= \frac{1}{1+s^2} \,.
$$
Recalling that $s(t) = \sinh(t)$, we conclude that the curvature of $\g$ is
$$
\kappa (t) = \tilde{\kappa}(s(t)) = \frac{1}{1+ \sinh(t)^2} = 
\frac{1}{\cosh(t)^2}
$$
where we used the identity $1 + \sinh^2 = \cosh^2$.

## Vector product in $\R^3$


The discussion in this section follows [@do-carmo]. We start by defining **orientation** for a vector space.


::: Definition
### Same orientation

Consider two ordered basis of $\R^3$
$$
B = (\bb_1,\bb_2,\bb_3) \,, \quad \tilde{B} = (\widetilde{\bb}_1,\widetilde{\bb}_2,\widetilde{\bb}_3) \,.
$$
We say that $B$ and $\widetilde{B}$ have the same orientation if the matrix of change of basis has positive determinant, that is, if 
$$
\det P > 0
$$
where $P \in \R^{3 \times 3}$ is such that
$$
\tilde{B} = P^{-1} B P \,.
$$

:::

When two basis $B$ and $\widetilde{B}$ have the same orientation, we write
$$
B \sim \widetilde{B} \,.
$$
The above is clearly an equivalence relation on the set of ordered basis. Therefore the set of ordered basis of $\R^3$ can be decomposed into equivalence classes.
Since the determinant of the matrix of change of basis can only be positive or negative, there are only two equivalence classes.


::: Definition 
### Orientation

The two equivalence classes determined by $\sim$ on the set of ordered basis are called **orientations**. 

:::



::: Definition 
### Positive orientation

Consider the standard basis of $\R^3$ 
$$
E = (\ee_1,\ee_2,\ee_3)
$$
where we set
$$
\ee_1 = (1,0,0)\,, \quad \ee_2 = (0,1,0) \,, \quad \ee_3 = (0,0,1) \,.
$$
Then:

- The orientation corresponding to $E$ is called **positive orientation** of $\R^3$.
- The orientation corresponding to the other equivalence class is called **negative orientation** of $\R^3$.


For a basis $B$ of $\R^3$ we say that:

- $B$ is a **positive basis** if it belongs to the class of $E$.
- $B$ is a **negative basis** if it does not belong to the class of $E$.
:::



::: Example

Since we are dealing with ordered basis, the order in which vectors appear is fundamental. For example, we defined the equivalence class of
$$
E = (\ee_1,\ee_2,\ee_3) \,,
$$
to be the positive orientation of $\R^3$. In particular $e$ is a positive basis.  
Consider instead
$$
\widetilde{E} = (\ee_2,\ee_1,\ee_3) \,.
$$
The matrix of change of variables between $\widetilde{E}$ and $E$ is 
$$
P = (\ee_2 | \ee_1 | \ee_3 ) = \left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & 1 & 0 \\ 
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{array}
\right)
$$
and clearly
$$
\det P = - 1 < 0 \,.
$$
Thus $\widetilde{E}$ does not belong to the class of $E$, and is therefore a negative basis. 
:::


We are now ready to define the vector product in $\R^3$.


::: Definition
### Vector product in $\R^3$   

Let $\uu,\vv \in \R^3$. The vector product of $\uu$ and $\vv$ is the unique vector 
$$
\uu \times \vv \in \R^3
$$
which satisfies the property:
$$
(\uu \times \vv) \cdot \ww = 
\left|
\begin{array}{ccc}
u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\
v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \\
w_1 & w_2 & w_3 \\
\end{array}
\right| \,, \quad \forall \, \ww \in \R^3 \,.
$${#eq-def-vector-product}
Here $|A|$ denotes the determinant of the matrix $A = (a_{ij})_{ij}$, and 
$u_i$, $v_i$, $w_i$ are the components of $\uu$, $\vv$, $\ww$, i.e.
$$
\uu= \sum_{i=1}^3 u_i \ee_i \,, \quad

\ww= \sum_{i=1}^3 w_i \ee_i \,,
$$
with $(\ee_1,\ee_2,\ee_3)$ standard basis of $\R^3$.
:::


The following proposition gives an explicit formula for computing $\uu \times \vv$.


::: Proposition

Let $\uu,\vv \in \R^3$. Then
$$
\uu \times \vv = 
\left|
\begin{array}{cc}
u_2 & u_3  \\

\right| \ee_2 +
\left|
\begin{array}{cc}
u_1 & u_2  \\
v_1 & v_2 
\end{array}
\right| \ee_3  \,. 
$$ {#eq-formula-cross-product}
:::




::: Proof
Denote by $(\uu \times \vv)_i$ the $i$-th component of $\uu \times \vv$ with respect to the standard basis, that is,
$$
\uu \times \vv = \sum_{i=1}^3  (\uu \times \vv)_i \, \ee_i \,.
$$
We can use (@eq-def-vector-product) with $\ww = \ee_1$ to obtain 
$$
(\uu \times \vv) \cdot \ee_1  = 
\left|
\begin{array}{ccc}
u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\
v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \\
 1  & 0   &   0 \\
\end{array}
\right| =
\left|
\begin{array}{cc}
u_2 & u_3  \\
v_2 & v_3 
\end{array}
\right|
$$
where we used the Laplace expansion for computing the determinant of the $3 \times 3$ matrix. As the standard basis is orthonormal, by bilinearity of the scalar product we get
$$
(\uu \times \vv) \cdot \ee_1 = \sum_{i=1}^3  (\uu \times \vv)_i \, \ee_i \cdot \ee_1 = (\uu \times \vv)_i \,.
$$
Therefore we have shown
$$
(\uu \times \vv)_1 = \left|
\begin{array}{cc}
u_2 & u_3  \\
v_2 & v_3 
\end{array}
\right| \,.
$$
Similarly we obtain
$$
(\uu \times \vv)_2  = \left|
\begin{array}{ccc}
u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\
v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \\
 0  & 1   &   0 \\
\end{array}
\right| = -
\left|
\begin{array}{cc}
u_1 & u_3  \\
v_1 & v_3 
\end{array}
\right|
$$
and 
$$
(\uu \times \vv)_3  = \left|
\begin{array}{ccc}
u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\
v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \\
 0  & 0   &   1 \\
\end{array}
\right| = 
\left|
\begin{array}{cc}
u_1 & u_2  \\
v_1 & v_2 
\end{array}
\right| \,,
$$
from which we conclude.

### Geometric interpretation of vector product   {#remark-vector-product}

Let $\uu, \vv \in \R^3$ be linearly independent. We make some observations:

1. Property 3 in Proposition \ref{proposition-vector-product} says that
$$
(\uu \times \vv) \cdot \uu = 0 \,, \quad  (\uu \times \vv) \cdot \vv = 0 \,.
$$
Therefore $\uu \times \vv$ is orthogonal to both $\uu$ and $\vv$. 

2. In particular $\uu \times \vv$ is orthogonal to the plane generated by $\uu$ and $\vv$.

3. Since $\uu$ and $\vv$ are linearly independent, Property 2 in Proposition \ref{proposition-vector-product} says that
$$
\uu \times \vv \neq \zero
$$

4. Therefore we have
$$
(\uu \times \vv) \cdot (\uu \times \vv) = \norm{ \uu \times \vv }^2 > 0 
$$

5. On the other hand, using the definition of $\uu \times \vv$ with $\ww = \vv \times \ww$ yields
$$
(\uu \times \vv) \cdot (\uu \times \vv) =
\left|
\begin{array}{ccc}
u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\
v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \\
(\uu \times \vv)_1 & (\uu \times \vv)_2 & (\uu \times \vv)_3 \\
\end{array}
\right| 
$$

6. Therefore the determinant of the matrix
$$
(\uu | \vv | \uu \times \vv)
$$
is positive. This shows that 
$$
(\uu , \vv , \uu \times \vv)
$$
is a **positive basis** of $\R^3$.

7. For all $\uu,\vv,\xx,\yy \in \R^3$ it holds
$$
(\uu \times \vv) \cdot (\xx \times \yy ) = 
\left|
\begin{array}{cc}
\uu \cdot \xx & \vv \cdot \xx  \\
\uu \cdot \yy & \vv \cdot \yy 
\end{array}
\right| \,.
$${#eq-formula-cross}
Indeed, one can check that the above formula holds for the standard vectors $\ee_i$, and thus the general formula follows by linearity.

8. Using (@eq-formula-cross) we get
\begin{align*}
\| \uu \times \vv \|^2 & = (\uu \times \vv) \cdot (\uu \times \vv) = 
\left|
\begin{array}{cc}
\uu \cdot \uu & \vv \cdot \uu  \\
\uu \cdot \vv & \vv \cdot \vv 
\end{array}
\right|   \\
& = \| \uu \|^2 \| \vv \|^2 - |\uu \cdot \vv|^2 \\
& = \| \uu \|^2 \| \vv \|^2 - \| \uu \|^2 \| \vv \|^2 \cos^2(\theta) \\
& = \| \uu \|^2 \| \vv \|^2 (1-\cos^2(\theta)) \\
& = \| \uu \|^2 \| \vv \|^2 \sin^2(\theta) \\
& = A^2  
\end{align*} 
where $A$ is the area of the parallelogram with sides $\uu$ and $\vv$.

![For $\uu,\vv$ linearly independent, $\uu \times \vv$ is orthogonal to the plane generated by $\uu,\vv$. Moreover $\|\uu \times \vv\|$ is the area of the parallelogram with sides $\uu,\vv$, and $(\uu,\vv,\uu \times \vv)$ is a positive basis of $\R^3$](/images/vector_product_orthogonal.png){width=70%}


We have therefore proven the following theorem.

::: Theorem
### Geometric Properties of vector product

Let $\uu,\vv \in \R^3$ be linearly independent. Then

- $\uu \times \vv$ is orthogonal to the plane spanned by $\uu,\vv$
- $\| \uu \times \vv \|$ is equal to the area of the parallelogram with sides $\uu,\vv$
- $\uu \times \vv$ is such that
$$
(\uu,\vv,\uu \times \vv)
$$
is a positive basis of $\R^3$.

:::



We conclude with noting that the cross product is not associative, and with a useful proposition for differentiating the cross product of curves in $\R^3$.



::: Proposition
The vector product is not associative. In particular, for all $\uu, \vv, \ww \in \R^3$ it holds:
$$
(\uu \times \vv) \times \ww = ( \uu \cdot \ww ) \vv - ( \vv \cdot \ww ) \uu \,.
$$ {#eq-cross-prod-triple}

:::


The proof is omitted. It follows by observing that both sides of (@eq-cross-prod-triple) are linear in $\uu, \vv, \ww$. Therefore it is sufficient to verify (@eq-cross-prod-triple) for the standard basis vectors $\ee_i$. This is left as an exercise.


::: Proposition

Suppose $\g,\eeta \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ are parametrized curves. Then
the curve 
$$
\g \times \eeta \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^3
$$
is smooth, and
$$
\frac{d}{dt} ( \g \times \eeta ) = \dg \times \eeta + \g \times \dot{\eeta} \,.
$${#eq-cross-prod-derivative}

:::

The proof is omitted. It follows immediately from formula (@eq-formula-cross-product).






## Curvature formula in $\R^3$


Given a unit-speed curve
$$
\g \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^n
$$
we defined its curvature as
$$
\kappa(t) := \norm{ \ddg(t) } \,.
$$
When $\g$ is regular we defined the curvature as
$$
\kappa(t) :=  \tilde{\kappa}(s(t))
$$
where
$$
\tilde{\kappa}(s) := \norm{ \ddtg(s) }
$$
is the curvature of the arc-length reparametrization $\tg := \g \circ s^{-1}$ of 
$\g$.

If $\g$ is a regular curve in $\R^3$ the following formula can be used to compute $\kappa$ without passing through $\tg$.

::: Proposition
### Curvature formula {#proposition-curvature-formula}

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be a regular curve. The curvature $\kappa(t)$ of $\g$ at $\g(t)$ is given by
$$
\kappa(t) = \frac{ \norm{\dg \times \ddg} }{ \norm{\dg}^3 } \,. 
$${#eq-curvature}

:::


We delay the proof of the above Proposition, as this will get easier when the **Frenet-Serret equations** are introduced. For a proof which does not make use of the Frenet-Serret equations see Proposition 2.1.2 in [@pressley].

For now we use (@eq-curvature) to compute the curvature of specific curves.


::: Example
### Curvature of the straight line

Consider the straight line
$$
\g(t) = \mathbf{a} + t \mathbf{v}
$$
for some $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{v} \in \R^3$ fixed, with $\mathbf{v} \neq \zero$. Then
$$
\dg (t) = \mathbf{v} \,, \quad \ddg(t) = \zero \,. 
$$
Therefore 
$$
\norm{\dg (t)} = \| \mathbf{v} \| \neq 0
$$
showing that $\g$ is regular. We have
$$
\dg \times \ddg = \mathbf{v} \times \zero = \zero \,.
$$
Therefore the curvature is
$$
\kappa(t) = \frac{ \norm{ \dg \times \ddg } }{ \norm{\dg}^3 } = 0 \,,
$$
as expected.
:::



::: Example
### Curvature of Helix {#example-curvature-helix}

Consider the Helix of radius $R>0$ and rise $H>0$
$$
\g (t) = ( R\cos(t) , R\sin(t) , Ht) \,, \quad t \in \R \,.
$$
Then
\begin{align*}
\dg (t) & = ( -R\sin(t) , R\cos(t) , H)  \\
\ddg (t) & = ( -R\cos(t) , -R\sin(t) , 0) 
\end{align*}
From this we deduce that
$$
\norm{\dg (t)}  = \sqrt{R^2 + H^2}\,,
$$
showing that $\g$ is regular. Finally
\begin{align*}
\dg \times \ddg & = 
\left|
\begin{array}{cc}
{\dot\gamma}_2 & {\dot\gamma}_3  \\
{\ddot\gamma}_2 & {\ddot\gamma}_3
\end{array}
\right| \ee_1 -
\left|
\begin{array}{cc}
{\dot\gamma}_1 & {\dot\gamma}_3  \\
{\ddot\gamma}_1 & {\ddot\gamma}_3
\end{array}
\right| \ee_2 +
\left|
\begin{array}{cc}
{\dot\gamma}_1 & {\dot\gamma}_2  \\
{\ddot\gamma}_1 & {\ddot\gamma}_2
\end{array}
\right| \ee_3 \\
& = 
\left|
\begin{array}{cc}
R\cos(t) & H \\
-R\sin(t) & 0
\end{array}
\right| \ee_1 -
\left|
\begin{array}{cc}
-R\sin(t) & H \\
-R\cos(t) & 0 
\end{array}
\right| \ee_2 +
\left|
\begin{array}{cc}
-R\sin(t) & R\cos(t) \\
-R\cos(t) & -R\sin(t)  
\end{array}
\right| \ee_3 \\
& = 
\left(   
RH\sin(t),    
-RH\cos(t),
 R^2\cos^2(t) + R^2\sin^2(t)
\right) \\
& = 
\left(   
RH\sin(t),    
-RH\cos(t),
R^2
\right) 
\end{align*}
and therefore
$$
\norm{ \dg \times \ddg } =  R\sqrt{R^2 + H^2   } \,.
$$
By the general formula we have
$$
\kappa = \frac{ \norm{ \dg \times \ddg } }{ \norm{\dg}^3 } =
\frac{ R (R^2 + H^2)^{\frac12} }{  (R^2 + H^2)^{\frac32}    } =
\frac{ R }{  R^2 + H^2   } 
$$

We notice the following:

1. If $H=0$ then the Helix is just a circle of radius $R$. In this case the curvature is
$$
\kappa  = \frac{1}{R}
$$
which agrees with the curvature computed for the circle of radius $R$.

2. If $R=0$ then the Helix is just parametrizing the $z$-axis. In this case the curvature is
$$
\kappa  = 0 \,,
$$
which agrees with the curvature of a straight line.

## Signed curvature of plane curves

In this section we assume to have plane curves, that is, curves with values in $\R^2$. In this case we can give a geometric interpretation for the sign of the curvature. This cannot be done in higher dimension.


::: Definition

Let $\g \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^2$ be unit-speed. We define the **signed unit normal** to $\g$ at $\g(t)$ as the unit vector $\nn(t)$ obtained by rotating $\dg(t)$ anti-clockwise by an angle of $\pi/2$.

:::


::: Definition

Let $\g \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^2$ be unit-speed. The **signed curvature** of $\g$ at $\g(t)$ is the scalar $\kappa_s(t)$ such that
$$
\ddg(t) = k_s(t) \nn(t)
$$
:::

::: Remark
Notice that since $\nn$ is a unit vector and $\g$ is unit-speed, then
$$
|\kappa_s(t)| = \norm{\ddg(t)} = \kappa(t) \,.
$$
We deduce that the signed curvature is related to the curvature by
$$
\kappa_s(t) = \pm \kappa(t) \,.
$$
:::


::: Remark
It can be shown that the signed curvature is the rate at which the tangent vector $\dg$ of the curve $\g$ rotates. The signed curvature is:

- positive if $\dg$ is rotating anti-clockwise
- negative if $\dg$ is rotating clockwise

In other words, 

- $k_s > 0$ means the curve is turning left,
- $k_s < 0$ means the curve is turning right.

A rigorous justification of the above statement is found in Proposition 2.2.3 in [@pressley].
:::



For curves which are not unit-speed, we define the signed curvature as the signed curvature of the unit-speed reparametrization. 



::: Definition

Let $\g \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^2$ be regular and let $\tg$ be a unit-speed reparametrization of $\g$. The **signed curvature** of $\g$ at $\g(t)$ is the scalar $\kappa_s(t)$ such that
$$
\ddtg(t) = k_s(t) \nn(t) \,,
$$
where $\nn(t)$ is the unit vector obtained by rotating $\dtg(t)$ anti-clockwise by an angle $\pi/2$.
:::


The signed curvature completely determines plane curves, in the sense of the following theorem.


::: Theorem
### Characterization of plane curves {#theorem-characterization-plane}

Let $\f \ \colon \R \to \R$ be smooth. Then:

1. There exists a unit-speed curve $\g \ \colon \R \to \R^2$ such that its signed curvature $\kappa_s$ satisfies
$$
\kappa_s(t) = \f(t) \,, \quad \forall \, t \in \R \,.
$$

2. Suppose that $\tg \ \colon \R \to \R^2$ is a unit-speed curve such that its signed curvature $\tilde{\kappa}_s$ satisfies
$$
\tilde{\kappa}_s(t) = \f(t) \,, \quad \forall \, t \in \R \,.
$$
Then 
$$
\tg = \g
$$
up to rotations and translations.
:::


We do not prove the above theorem. For a proof, see Theorem 2.2.6 in [@pressley].






## Space curves

We will now deal with **space curves**, that is, curves with values in $\R^3$. There are several issues compared to the plane case:

- A 3D counterpart of the signed curvature is not available, since there is no notion of *turning left* or *turning right*.

- We have seen in the previous section that the signed curvature completely characterizes plane curves. In 3D however curvature is not enough to characterize curves: there exist $\g$ and $\eeta$ space curves such that 
$$
\kappa^{\g} = \kappa^{\eeta} \quad \text{ but } \quad  \g \neq \eeta \,,
$$
that is, $\g$ and $\eeta$ have same curvature but are different curves.



::: Example
### Different curves with same curvature

Let $\g$ be a circle of radius $R>0$
$$
\g(t) = (R\cos(t),R\sin(t),0) \,,
$$
and $\eeta$ be a helix of radius $S>0$ and rise $H>0$
$$
\eeta(t) = (S\cos(t),S\sin(t),Ht) \,.
$$
We have computed that 
$$
\kappa^\g = \frac{1}{R}\,, \quad 
\kappa^\eeta = \frac{S}{S^2 + H^2} \,.
$$
If we now choose $R=2$ and we impose that $\kappa^\g = \kappa^\eeta$ we get
$$
\frac12 = \frac{S}{S^2 + H^2} \quad \implies \quad  H^2 = 2S - S^2 
$$
Choosing $S=1$ and $H=1$ yields 
$$
\kappa^\g = \kappa^\eeta \,, \quad   \g \neq \eeta \,.
$$
:::


Therefore curvature is not enough for characterizing space curves, and we need a new quantity. 
As we did with curvature, we start by considering the simpler case of unit-speed curves. We will also
need to assume that the curvature is never zero.

We start by introducing the *principal normal*, which is
just the unit vector obtained by renormalizing $\ddg$.


::: Definition
### Principal normal vector

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be a unit-speed curve with 
$$
\kappa(t) \neq 0 \,, \quad \forall \,t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
The **principal normal vector** to $\g$ at $\g(t)$ is 
$$
\nn(t) := \frac{1}{\kappa (t)} \, \ddg(t) \,.
$$
:::



::: Remark

The principal normal is a unit vector orthogonal to $\dg$, that is,
$$
\norm{ \nn (t) } = 1 \,, \qquad \dg \cdot \nn = 0 \,.
$$

>*Proof.* For $\g$ unit-speed we defined the curvature as
$$
\kappa (t) := \norm{ \ddg(t) } \,.
$$
Therefore 
$$
\| \nn \| = \frac{1}{\norm{ \ddg(t) }} \, \norm{ \ddg(t) } = 1
$$
In addition for $\g$ unit-speed it holds that $\dg \cdot \ddg = 0$. Therefore
$$
\dg \cdot \nn = \frac{1}{\kappa} \, \dg \cdot \ddg = 0 \,.
$$

::: Question
Why is the principal normal interesting? Because it can tell the difference beween a plane curve and a space curve, see @fig-principal-normal.
:::

We now introduce the binormal vector $\bb$ as the vector product of $\dg$ and $\nn$. By the properties of vector
product we will see that the triple 
$$
(\dg, \nn, \bb)
$$
forms a positive orthonormal basis of $\R^3$.


::: Definition
### Binormal vector

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be a unit-speed curve with 
$$
\kappa(t) \neq 0 \,, \quad \forall \,t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
The **binormal vector** to $\g$ at $\g(t)$ is 
$$
\bb(t) := \dg (t) \times \nn(t) \,.
$$
:::



::: Definition
### Orthonormal basis

Let $\vv_1, \vv_2, \vv_3$ be vectors in $\R^3$. We say that the triple
$$
\{\vv_1, \vv_2,\vv_3\}
$$
is **orthonormal** if 
$$
\norm{v_i} = 1 \,, \quad   v_i \cdot v_j = 0 \,, \,\, \mbox{ for } \, i \neq j \,.
$$
:::



::: Proposition
Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be a unit-speed curve with
$$
\kappa(t) \neq 0 \,, \quad \forall \,t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
Then the triple
$$
B = (  \dg(t), \nn(t), \bb(t)  )
$$
is a positive orthonormal basis of $\R^3$ for all $t \in (a,b)$.
:::



::: Proof

Since $\g$ is unit-speed we have
$$
\norm{ \dg (t) } \equiv 1 \,.
$$
Moreover we have already observed that 
$$
\norm{\nn(t)} \equiv 1 \,, \quad \dg (t) \cdot \nn(t) \equiv 0 \,.
$$
As $\bb$ is defined by
$$
\bb:= \dg \times \nn \,,
$$
by the properties of the vector product, see Proposition \ref{proposition-vector-product}, it follows that
$$
\bb \cdot \dg = 0 \,, \quad  \bb \cdot \nn = 0  \,.
$$
By the calculation in Remark \ref{remark-vector-product} Point 8, we have that
$$
\norm{ \bb }^2 = \| \dg \|^2 \|\nn \|^2 -   |\dg \cdot \nn|^2 = 1   \,.
$$
This shows that the vectors $\{ \dg, \nn, \bb \}$
are orthonormal. By the properties of the vector product, see Remark \ref{remark-vector-product} Point 6, we also know that
$$
( \dg, \nn, \bb  )
$$
is a positive basis of $\R^3$.
:::


Therefore to each unit-speed curve $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ with non-vanishing curvature we can associate a positive orthonormal basis of $\R^3$. Such basis is known as Frenet frame.


::: Definition
### Frenet frame

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be unit-speed with $\kappa \neq 0$. The positive orthonormal basis of $\R^3$
$$
( \dg, \nn, \bb )
$$
is called **Frenet frame** of $\g$.

:::


::: Notation
For $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ unit-speed the **tangent vector** is often denoted by
$$
\ttt := \dg
$$
Therefore the Frenet frame of $\g$ can be equivalently written as
$$
( \ttt, \nn, \bb ) \,.
$$

:::



By using unit-speed reparametrizations we 
can also compute the Frenet frame for regular curves with non-vanishing curvature. In doing so, we need to be aware 
of the following:


::: Warning 

The Frenet frame depends on the **orientation** of the curve, see next Definition and Proposition.

:::


::: Definition

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be regular and
$\tg$ be a reparametrization with
$$
\g = \tg \circ \phi \,,  \quad \f \colon  (a,b) \to (\tilde{a},\tilde{b})  \,.
$$
We say that

1. $\tg$ is *orientation preserving* if $\dot \f > 0$
2. $\tg$ is *orientation reversing* if $\dot \f < 0$

:::



::: Proposition
### Frenet frame of reparametrization {#proposition-frenet-reparametrization}

Let $\g$ be a unit-speed curve with $\kappa \neq 0$. Let
$\tg$ be a unit-speed reparametrization with
$$
\g = \tg \circ \phi \,,  \quad \f \colon  (a,b) \to (\tilde{a},\tilde{b})  \,.
$$
Then $\dot{\f}$ is constant, with either 
$$
\dot{\f}  \equiv 1 \quad \text{or} \quad 
\dot{\f}  \equiv - 1
$$
Denote by 
$$
(\ttt, \nn, \bb)\,, \qquad 
(\tilde{\ttt}, \tilde{\nn}, \tilde{\bb})
$$
the Frenet frames of $\g$ and $\tg$, respectively. We have:

1. If $\tg$ is *orientation preserving* then $\dot \f \equiv 1$ and
$$
\ttt = \tilde{\ttt} \circ \f , \quad \nn = \tilde{\nn} \circ \f, \quad 
\bb = \tilde{\bb} \circ \f
$$

2. If $\tg$ is *orientation reversing* then $\dot \f \equiv -1$ and
$$
\ttt = - \tilde{\ttt} \circ \f , \quad \nn = \tilde{\nn} \circ \f, \quad 
\bb = -\tilde{\bb} \circ \f
$$

:::



::: Proof

Differentiating $\g = \dg \circ \phi$ gives
$$
\dg(t) = \dtg ( \f(t) ) \ \dot{\f}(t)
$${#eq-chain-unit-speed}
Taking the norms in (@eq-chain-unit-speed) and recalling 
that $\g$ and $\tg$ are unit speed yields
$|\dot{\f} | = 1$. 
By continuity of $\dot \f$ either
$$
\dot{\f}  \equiv 1 \quad \text{or} \quad 
\dot{\f}  \equiv - 1
$${#eq-chain-unit-speed-2}
Differentiating (@eq-chain-unit-speed) one more time 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\ddg(t) & = \ddtg ( \f(t) ) \ \dot{\f}^2(t) + \dtg ( \f(t) ) \ \ddot{\f}(t) \\

$${#eq-chain-unit-speed-3}
where we used (@eq-chain-unit-speed-2). By definition 
$$
\ttt := \dg \,, \qquad \tilde{\ttt} := \dtg 
$$
Therefore (@eq-chain-unit-speed) reads
$$
\ttt(t) = \tilde{\ttt}( \f(t) ) \ \dot{\f}(t)
$${#eq-chain-unit-speed-4}
By Proposition \ref{proposition-curvature-invariant} the 
curvatures $\kappa, \tilde{\kappa}$ of $\g, \tg$ are related by
$$
\kappa(t) = \tilde{\kappa}( \f (t))  \,.
$${#eq-chain-unit-speed-5}
Dividing both sides of (@eq-chain-unit-speed-3) by $\kappa(t)$ 
and using (@eq-chain-unit-speed-5) gives
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{\kappa(t)} \ \ddg (t) & =
\frac{1}{\kappa(t)} \ \ddtg (\f(t)) \\
& = \frac{1}{\tilde{\kappa}(\f(t))} \ \ddtg(\f(t))
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-chain-unit-speed-6}
By definition the principal normals are
$$
\nn := \frac{1}{\kappa} \ \ddg \,, \qquad

$$
and therefore (@eq-chain-unit-speed-6) reads
$$
\nn(t) = \tilde{\nn} ( \f(t) ) 
$${#eq-chain-unit-speed-7}
Recall the definition of binormal
$$

Using (@eq-chain-unit-speed-4) and (@eq-chain-unit-speed-7) then gives
\begin{align*}

       & = \tilde{\bb}( \f(t) ) \ \dot{\f} (t) 
\end{align*}
To summarize, we have shown the following relations between the Frenet frames of $\g$ and $\tg$
$$
\begin{aligned}
\ttt(t) & = \tilde{\ttt}( \f(t) ) \ \dot{\f}(t) \\
\nn(t) & = \tilde{\nn} ( \f(t) ) \\
\bb(t) & = \tilde{\bb}( \f(t) ) \ \dot{\f} (t) 
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-chain-unit-speed-8}
We can finally conclude:

1. If $\tg$ is orientation preserving then $\dot \f > 0$. By (@eq-chain-unit-speed-2) we infer $\dot \f \equiv 1$, so that the equations at (@eq-chain-unit-speed-8) read
$$
\ttt = \tilde{\ttt} \circ \f , \quad \nn = \tilde{\nn} \circ \f, \quad 
\bb = \tilde{\bb} \circ \f
$$

2. If $\tg$ is orientation reversing then $\dot \f < 0$. By (@eq-chain-unit-speed-2) we infer $\dot \f \equiv - 1$, so that the equations at (@eq-chain-unit-speed-8) read
$$
\ttt = - \tilde{\ttt} \circ \f , \quad \nn = \tilde{\nn} \circ \f, \quad 
\bb = - \tilde{\bb} \circ \f
$$

:::


In conclusion, the Frenet frame is not invariant under 
reparametrization. However the Frenet vectors stay the same,
up to changing the sign of tangent and binormal.

$$
\ttt = \pm \tilde{\ttt} \circ \f , \quad \nn = \tilde{\nn} \circ \f, \quad 
\bb = \pm \tilde{\bb} \circ \f
$$




Let us conclude the section with an example, where we compute
the Frenet frame of the Helix.


::: Example
### Frenet frame of Helix {#example-helix-frenet}

Consider the helix of radius $R>0$ and rise $H$ given by
$$
\g (t) = ( R\cos(t), R\sin(t),t H)\,,
$$
for $t \in \R$. We have that
$$
\dg (t) = ( -R\sin(t), R\cos(t), H )
$$
which implies
$$
\norm{ \dg } = \rho, \qquad \rho := \sqrt{R^2 + H^2} \,.
$$
This shows that $\g$ is regular, since
$$
\norm{ \dg } = \rho = \sqrt{R^2 + H^2} \geq \sqrt{R^2} = R > 0
$$
However $\g$ is not unit-speed in general. 
We know that all unit-speed reparametrizations are of the form
$$
\f = \pm s + c \,,
$$
where $s$ is the arc-length and $c \in \R$. Therefore we compute the arc-length of $\g$ starting at $t_0 = 0$
$$
s(t) := \int_0^t \norm{ \dg(u) } \, du = \rho  t \,.  
$$
The arc-length function is invertible with inverse 
$$
\psi(s) := t(s) = \frac{s}{\rho} \,.
$$
Therefore a unit-speed reparametrization of $\g$ is given by
$$
\tg(s):= \g( t(s)) = \left( R \cos \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) ,R \sin \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) , \frac{H s }{\rho}    \right) \,.
$$
We compute the tangent vector to $\tg$ and its derivative
\begin{align*}
\tilde{\ttt} & = \dtg  = \frac{1}{\rho}
 \left(  - R \sin \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) , 
 R \cos \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) 
 , H    \right) \\
\dot{\tilde{\ttt}} & = \frac{R}{\rho^2} \left(  -\cos \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) , -\sin \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) , 0    \right)
\end{align*}
We have already computed the curvature of the Helix in 
Example \ref{example-curvature-helix} by using the general 
formula. We now compute it again, but this time by using the
unit-speed reparametrization just obtained:
$$
\tilde{\kappa} (s) = \norm{ \dot{\tilde{\ttt}} } = \frac{R}{\rho^2} = \frac{R}{R^2 + H^2}\,.
$$
The principal normal vector is then
$$
\tilde{\nn} = \frac{1}{\tilde{\kappa}(t)} \, \dot{\tilde{\ttt}} = \left(  -\cos \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) , -\sin \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) , 0    \right) \,.
$$
We can now compute the binormal
\begin{align*}
\tilde{\bb}& = \tilde{\ttt} \times \tilde{\nn}  \\
    & = \frac{1}{\rho}
    \left|
    \begin{array}{ccc}
    \ii & \jj & \kk \\
    - R \sin \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right)  & R \cos \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) & H \\
    - \cos \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) & - \sin \left( \frac{s}{ \rho }  \right) & 0 
    \end{array}
    \right| \\
    & =  \frac{H}{\rho} \left(  \sin \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) , -  \cos \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) ,  R \right) \,.
\end{align*}
This concludes the calculation of the Frenet frame of $\tg$. 
For the choice of $R = 1$ and $H = 1$ the Frenet frame is plotted in @fig-helix-frenet.

**Note:** If we had reparametrized $\g$ by $-s$ instead of $s$, we would have obtained the Frenet frame
$$
(- \tilde{\ttt} , \tilde{\nn}, - \tilde{\bb})
$$
in accordance with Proposition \ref{proposition-frenet-reparametrization}.

## Torsion

For space curves with non-vanishing curvature we can define
another scalar quantity, known as *torsion*. Such quantity
allows to measure by how much a curve fails to be planar. 

The torsion can be defined by computing the derivative of the binormal vector $\bb$. 


::: {.Proposition #proposition-binormal}

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be a unit-speed curve with $\kappa \neq 0$. Then
$$
\dot{\bb} (t) = - \tau(t) \nn(t) \,,
$$ {#eq-binormal-derivative}
for some $\tau(t) \in \R$. 

:::


::: Proof

By definition $\bb = \ttt \times \nn$. Using the formula of derivation of the cross product (@eq-cross-prod-derivative) we have
\begin{align*}
\dot{\bb} & = \frac{d}{dt} ( \ttt \times \nn  ) \\
          & = \dot{\ttt} \times \nn + \ttt \times \dot{\nn} \\
          & =  \ttt \times \dot{\nn} \,,
\end{align*}
where we used that, by definition of $\nn$,
$$
\dot{\ttt} \times \nn  = \frac{1}{\kappa} \dot{\ttt} \times \dot{\ttt} = \zero \,.
$$
This shows
$$
\dot{\bb} = \dg \times \dot{\nn} \,.
$${#eq-derivative-b-1}
By the properties of the cross product we have 
that $\ttt \times \dot{\nn}$ is orthogonal to both $\ttt$
and $\dot{\nn}$. Thus (@eq-derivative-b-1) implies that
$$
\dot{\bb} \cdot \ttt = 0 \,.
$$
Further, observe that
$$
\frac{d}{dt}( \bb \cdot \bb ) = \dot{\bb} \cdot \bb + \bb \cdot \dot{\bb} = 2\dot{\bb} \cdot \bb \,.
$$
On the other hand, since $\bb$ is a unit vector, we have 
$$
\frac{d}{dt}( \bb \cdot \bb ) = \frac{d}{dt}( \norm{\bb}^2 ) = \frac{d}{dt}( 1 ) = 0 \,  
$$
Therefore 
$$
\dot{\bb} \cdot \bb = 0 \,.
$$
showing that $\dot{\bb}$ is orthogonal to $\bb$. We also shown that $\dot{\bb}$ is orthogonal to $\ttt$. Since the Frenet frame
$$
( \ttt, \nn , \bb )
$$
is an orthonormal basis of $\R^3$, and $\dot{\bb}$ is orthogonal to both $\ttt$ and $\bb$, we conclude that $\dot{\bb}$ is parallel to $\nn$. Therefore there exists $\tau(t) \in \R$ such that 
$$
\dot{\bb} = - \tau(t) \nn(t) \,,
$$
concluding the proof.
:::

The scalar $\tau$ in equation (@eq-binormal-derivative) is called the torsion of $\g$.

::: Definition
### Torsion of unit-speed curve with $\kappa \neq 0$

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be a unit-speed curve, with $\kappa \neq 0$. The **torsion** of $\g$ at $\g(t)$ is the unique scalar
$$
\tau (t) \in \R
$$
such that
$$
\dot{\bb} (t) = - \tau(t) \nn(t) \,.
$$

:::



::: Remark
### Formula for torsion {#remark-torsion-formula}

In particular the torsion satisfies:
$$
\tau(t) = - \dot{\bb} (t) \cdot \nn (t) \,.
$$

> *Proof.* Multiply (@eq-binormal-derivative) by $\nn$ and note that $\| \nn \| = 1$.

:::



::: Warning

We defined the torsion **only** for space curves  $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$
which are unit-speed and have non-vanishing curvature, that is, such that
$$
\norm{\dg(t)} = 1 \,, \quad \kappa(t) = \norm{ \ddg(t) }  \neq 0 \,, \qquad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$

:::


As we did for curvature, we can extend the definition of torsion to regular curves $\g$ with non-vanishing curvature.


::: Definition
### Torsion of regular curve with $\kappa \neq 0$ {#definition-torsion-regular}


Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be a regular curve, with $\kappa \neq 0$. Let $\tg$ be a unit-speed reparametrization of 
$\g$, with 
$$
\g = \tg \circ \phi \,,  \quad \f \colon  (a,b) \to (\tilde{a},\tilde{b})  \,.
$$
Denote by $\tilde{\tau} \colon (\tilde{a},\tilde{b}) \to \R$ the torsion of $\tg$. The **torsion** of $\g$ at $\g(t)$ is defined by
$$
\tau(t) := \tilde{\tau}(\f(t))
$$

:::


As usual, we need to check that the above definition of torsion does not depend 
on the choice of unit-speed reparametrization $\tg$.


::: Proposition 
### $\tau$ is invariant for unit-speed reparametrization

Consider the setting of Definition \ref{definition-torsion-regular}. Let $\hat{\g}$ is another
unit-speed reparametrization of $\g$, with $\g = \hat{\g} \circ \psi$. Then
$$
\tau(t) = \tilde{\tau}( \f (t) ) = \hat{\tau}( \psi (t) ) 
$$
where $\hat{\tau}$ is the torsion of $\hat{\g}$.

:::


::: Proof

The curves $\tg$ and $\hat{\g}$ are unit-speed, therefore
they are defined their Frenet frames
$$
(\tilde{\ttt}, \tilde{\nn}, \tilde{\bb}) \,, \qquad
(\hat{\ttt}, \hat{\nn}, \hat{\bb})
$$
Since $\tg$ and $\hat{\g}$ are both reparametrization of $\g$
$$
\tg(\f(t)) = \g(t) = \hat{\g}(\psi(t))
$$
Using that $\f$ is invertible we obtain
$$
\tg(t) = \hat{\g} (\xi(t)) \,, \qquad \xi := \psi \circ \f^{-1} 
$$
with $\xi$ diffeomorphims.
The above formula is saying that $\hat{\g}$ is a reparametrization of $\tg$. As both $\tg$ and $\hat{\g}$ are unit-speed, we can apply Proposition \ref{proposition-frenet-reparametrization} and infer that the Frenet frames are linked by the formulas
$$
\tilde{\ttt} = \pm \, \hat{\ttt} \circ \xi \,, \qquad 
\tilde{\nn} = \hat{\nn} \circ \xi \,, \qquad 
\tilde{\bb} = \pm \, \hat{\bb} \circ \xi
$${#eq-torsion-invariant-1}
and $\xi$ satisfies
$$
\dot \xi \equiv \pm 1 \,.
$$
Differentiating the third equation in (@eq-torsion-invariant-1) gives
$$
\dot{\tilde{\bb}}(t) = \pm \, \frac{d}{dt} \hat{\bb}(\xi(t)) = 
\pm \, \dot {\hat{\bb}} (\xi(t)) \dot \xi (t) = \dot {\hat{\bb}} (\xi(t))
$${#eq-torsion-invariant-2}
where we used that $\dot\xi \equiv \pm 1$.
By Remark \ref{remark-torsion-formula} the torsions of $\tg$ and $\dtg$ are computed by
$$
\tilde{\tau} = - \dot{ \tilde{\bb} } \cdot \tilde{\nn} \,, \qquad  
\hat{\tau} = - \dot{ \hat{\bb} } \cdot \hat{\nn}
$$
Using the second equation in (@eq-torsion-invariant-1) and (@eq-torsion-invariant-2) allows to infer
$$
\tilde{\tau} (t) = - \dot{ \tilde{\bb} }(t) \cdot \tilde{\nn}(t) = - \dot{ \hat{\bb} }(\xi(t)) \cdot \hat{\nn}(\xi(t)) = 
\hat{\tau}(\xi(t))
$$
Recalling that $\xi = \psi \circ \f^{-1}$ we conclude
$$
\tilde{\tau} (\f(t)) = \hat{\tau}(\psi(t))
$$
as required. 

:::






As with the curvature, there is a general 
formula to compute the torsion without having to reparametrize.


::: Proposition 
### Torsion formula   {#proposition-torsion-formula}

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be a regular curve with non-vanishing curvature. The torsion $\tau(t)$ of $\g$ at $\g(t)$ is given by
$$
\tau (t) = \frac{ ( \dg \times \ddg ) \cdot \dddg }{ \norm{ \dg \times \ddg }^2 } \,. 
$${#eq-torsion-formula}

:::

We delay the proof of the above Proposition, as this will get easier when the **Frenet-Serret equations** are introduced. For a proof which does not make use of the Frenet-Serret equations, see the proof of Proposition 2.3.1 in [@pressley].

For now we use (@eq-torsion-formula) to compute the curvature of specific curves.




::: Example
### Torsion Helix {#example-torsion-helix}


Consider the Helix of radius $R>0$ and rise $H>0$
$$
\g (t) = ( R\cos(t) , R\sin(t) , Ht) \,, \quad t \in \R \,.
$$
We have already shown that
$$
\norm{\dg (t)}  = \sqrt{R^2 + H^2}\,,  \quad  \kappa = \frac{R}{R^2 + H^2} \,.
$$
Therefore the Helix is regular with non-vanishing curvature. The torsion can be then
computed via the formula 
$$
\tau (t) = \frac{ ( \dg \times \ddg ) \cdot \dddg }{ \norm{ \dg \times \ddg }^2 } \,. 
$$
Let us compute the quantities appearing in the formula for $\tau$
\begin{align*}
\dg (t) & = ( -R\sin(t) , R\cos(t) , H)  \\
\ddg (t) & = ( -R\cos(t) , -R\sin(t) , 0) \\
\dddg (t) & = ( R\sin(t) , -R\cos(t) , 0) 
\end{align*}
Moreover we had already computed that
\begin{align*}
\dg \times \ddg & = \left( RH\sin(t), -RH\cos(t), R^2 \right)  \\
\norm{ \dg \times \ddg } & =  R\sqrt{R^2 + H^2   } \,.
\end{align*}
Finally we compute
$$
(\dg \times \ddg) \cdot \dddg = R^2 H \,.
$$
We are ready to find the torsion:
$$
\tau = \frac{ ( \dg \times \ddg ) \cdot \dddg }{ \norm{ \dg \times \ddg }^2 }
       = \frac{ H }{ R^2 + H^2 } \,.
$$
:::


As a consequence of the above example, we can immediately
infer curvature and torsion formulas for the circle.



::: Example 
### Curvature and Torsion of Circle   {#example-circle-curvature-torsion}

The Circle of radius $R>0$ is
$$
\g(t) := ( R \cos(t), R \sin(t) , 0 ) \,.
$$
The curvature and torsion of the Helix of radius $R$ and rise $H>0$ are
$$
\kappa = \frac{R}{R^2 + H^2}\,, \quad \tau = \frac{H}{R^2 + H^2}  \,.
$$
For $H=0$ the Helix coincides with the Circle $\g$. Therefore we can set $H=0$ in the 
above formulas to obtain the 
curvature and torsion of the Circle
$$
\kappa = \frac{1}{R}\,, \quad \tau = 0  \,.
$$

:::


From the above example we notice that the torsion of the circle is $0$. This is true in general for space curves which are contained in a plane: we will prove this result in general. For the moment, let us give an example for which this happens, that is, an example of space curve $\g$ which is contained in a plane. 


::: {.Example  #example-circle-rotated}
Define the space curve
$$
\g(t) := \left( \frac45 \cos(t),  1 - \sin(t) , -\frac35 \cos(t)  \right) \,,
$$
for $t \in \R$. As seen in the plot in @fig-circle-rigid, $\g$ is just a Circle which has been rotated an translated. Therefore $\g$ is contained in a plane, and we expect curvature and torsion to be
$$
\kappa = \frac1R , \quad \tau = 0\,, 
$$
for some $R>0$, radius of the Circle $\g$. Let us proceed with the calculations:
$$
\dg =   \left( -\frac45 \sin(t),  - \cos(t) , \frac35 \sin(t)  \right)
$$
so that 
$$
\norm{ \dg }^2 = \frac{16}{25} \sin^2(t) + \cos^2(t) + \frac{9}{25} \sin^2(t) = 1\,,
$$
showing that $\g$ is regular and unit-speed. 
Therefore we can compute curvature and torsion by using the Frenet frame. We have
$$
\ddg  =  \left( -\frac45 \cos(t),  \sin(t) , \frac35 \cos(t)  \right) \,.
$$
As $\g$ is unit-speed, the curvature and principal normal are
\begin{align*}
\kappa & = \norm{ \ddot \g } = \frac{16}{25} \cos^2(t) + \sin^2(t) + \frac{9}{25} \cos^2(t) = 1 \\
\nn & = \frac{1}{\kappa}  \ddg =  \left( -\frac45 \cos(t),  \sin(t) , \frac35 \cos(t)  \right) \,.
\end{align*}
We can then compute the binormal
\begin{align*}
\bb & = \dg \times \nn \\ 
    & = 
    \left|
\begin{array}{ccc}
\ii & \jj & \kk \\
-\frac{4}{5} \sin (t)  & - \cos(t) & \frac35 \sin(t) \\
 -\frac45 \cos(t) &  \sin(t) & \frac35 \cos(t) 
\end{array} \right| \\
    & = \left(  -\frac35 \cos^2(t) - \frac35 \sin^2(t), - \frac{12}{25} \cos(t) \sin(t) + \frac{12}{25} \cos(t) \sin(t), - \frac45 \sin^2(t) - \frac45 \cos^2(t)   \right) \\
    & = \left( -\frac35, 0 ,-\frac45  \right) \,.
\end{align*}
In particular
$$
\dot{\bb} = 0\,,
$$
and we obtain that the torsion is
$$
\tau = - \dot{\bb} \cdot \nn = 0 \,.

Let us summarize our findings about curvature and torsion.


::: Important
### Summary

Recall that:

1. Curvature $\kappa$ is defined only for regular curves.
2. Torsion $\tau$ is defined only for regular curves with non-vanishing $\kappa$.
3. Both $\kappa$ and $\tau$ are invariant under unit-speed reparametrizations

The two strategies for computing $\kappa$ and $\tau$ are summarized in the diagram in @fig-diagram.

:::

![How to compute $\kappa$ and $\tau$ for regular curve $\g$.](/images/diagram_curvature_torsion.png){#fig-diagram width=80%}




We have already made an example in which we compute
curvature and torsion of the Helix using the general formulas
$$
\kappa = \frac{\norm{ \dg \times \ddg }}{ \norm{ \dg }^2 } \,, \qquad
\tau = \frac{ (\dg \times \ddg ) \cdot \dddg }{ \norm{ \dg \times \ddg }^2 } \,.
$$
We conclude the section by providing an example where we compute curvature and torsion by making use of the Frenet frame.



::: Example
### Curvature and torsion of Helix with Frenet frame

Consider the helix of radius $R>0$ and rise $H$ given by
$$
\g (t) = ( R\cos(t), R\sin(t),t H )\,,
$$
for $t \in \R$. We want to compute curvature and torsion by following the diagram at @fig-diagram.
We ask the first question:
$$
\mbox{Is $\g$ unit-speed?}
$$
We have already computed in Example \ref{example-helix-frenet} that
$$
\norm{ \dg } = \rho \,, \qquad \rho := \sqrt{R^2 + H^2} \,.
$$
This shows that $\g$ is regular but not unit-speed. We ask the second question in the diagram:
$$
\mbox{Can we find the arc-length reparametrization of $\g$?}
$$
We have already computed the arc-length reparametrization
of $\g$ in Example \ref{example-helix-frenet}. This is given
by 
$$
\tg(s) = \left( R \cos \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) ,R \sin \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) , \frac{H s }{\rho}    \right) \,.
$$
The next step in the diagram is
$$
\mbox{Compute Frenet frame $\{ \ttt, \nn, \bb \}$ and curvature $\kappa$, torsion $\tau$}
$$
From Example \ref{example-helix-frenet}, the Frenet frame and curvature of $\tg$ are
\begin{align*}
\tilde{\ttt} & =  \frac{1}{\rho}
 \left(  - R \sin \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) , 
 R \cos \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) 
 , H    \right)\\
\tilde{\nn} & = \left(  -\cos \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) , -\sin \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) , 0    \right) \\
\tilde{\bb} & = \frac{H}{\rho} \left(  \sin \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) , -  \cos \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) ,  R \right) \\
\tilde{\kappa} & = \norm{ \dot{\tilde{\ttt}} } = \frac{R}{\rho^2} = \frac{R}{R^2 + H^2}
\end{align*}
we are left to compute the torsion using formula
$$
\tilde{\tau} = - \dot{\tilde{\bb}} \cdot \tilde{\nn} 
$$
Indeed, we have
$$
\dot{\tilde{\bb}} = \frac{H}{\rho^2} \left(  \cos \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) , \sin \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) , 0   \right)
$$
and therefore 
$$
\dot{\tilde{\bb}} \cdot \nn = \frac{H}{\rho^2} \left( - \cos^2 \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) -  \sin^2 \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) \right) = - \frac{H}{\rho^2} \,.
$$
The torsion is then
$$
\tilde{\tau} = - \dot{\tilde{\bb}} \cdot \tilde{\nn} = \frac{H}{\rho^2} = \frac{H}{R^2 + H^2} \,,
$$
which of course agrees with the calculation for $\tau$ in Example \ref{example-torsion-helix}.

## Frenet-Serret equations

For unit-speed curves $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ with non-vanishing curvature we introduced the Frenet frame
$$
\{ \ttt, \nn, \bb \} \,.
$$
We proved that the Frenet frame is a positive orthonormal basis of $\R^3$. We also used such basis to compute curvature $\kappa$ and torsion $\tau$ of $\g$:
$$
\kappa := \| \dot{\ttt} \| \,, \quad \tau := - \dot{\bb} \cdot \nn \,. 
$$

In this section we show that the Frenet frame satisfies a linear system of ODEs
known as the Frenet-Serret equations. In order to do this, we first need 
prove that the Frenet frame 
$$
( \ttt, \nn, \bb  )
$$ 
is *right-handed*. Such property holds in 
general for any positive basis of $\R^3$ of the form
$$
(\uu, \vv , \ww ) \,, \qquad \ww := \uu \times \vv \,.
$$



::: Proposition
### Frenet frame is right-handed {#proposition-positive-basis}

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be a unit-speed curve with $\kappa \neq 0$. The Frenet frame is *right-handed*, in the sense that
$$
\bb = \ttt \times \nn \,, \quad
\nn = \bb \times \ttt \,, \quad
\ttt = \nn \times \bb \,.
$$ {#eq-frenet-positive-basis}

:::


::: Proof

The first equation in (@eq-frenet-positive-basis) is true by definition of $\bb$. For the remaining $2$ equations, recall formula (@eq-cross-prod-triple): 
$$
(\uu \times \vv ) \times \ww = ( \uu \cdot \ww) \vv - ( \vv \cdot \ww ) \uu \,,
$${#eq-cross-prod-triple-1}
which holds for all $\uu,\vv,\ww \in \R^3$. Applying (@eq-cross-prod-triple-1) to
$$
\uu = \ttt \,, \quad \vv = \nn \,, \quad \ww = \ttt \,,
$$
yields
\begin{align*}
( \ttt \times \nn ) \times \ttt & = ( \ttt \cdot \ttt ) \nn - (\nn \cdot \ttt) \ttt \\
                                      & = \norm{\ttt }^2 \nn - \zero \\
                                      & = \nn \,,
\end{align*}
where we used that $\ttt$ is a unit vector and $\nn \cdot \ttt = 0$. Therefore, by definition of $\bb$, we have
$$
\bb \times \ttt = ( \ttt \times \nn ) \times \ttt = \nn
$$
obtaining the second equation in (@eq-frenet-positive-basis). Now we apply (@eq-cross-prod-triple-1) to 
$$
\uu = \ttt \,, \quad \vv = \nn \,, \quad \ww = \nn \,,
$$
to get
\begin{align*}
( \ttt \times \nn ) \times \nn  & = ( \ttt \cdot \nn ) \nn - (\nn \cdot \nn ) \ttt \\
                                      & = \zero - \| \nn \|^2 \ttt  \\
                                      & = - \ttt
\end{align*}
where we used that $\nn$ is a unit vector and $\ttt \cdot \nn= 0$. Therefore, by definition of $\bb$ and anti-commutativity of the vector product, we have
$$
\nn \times \bb = - \bb \times \nn = - (\ttt \times \nn ) \times \nn = \ttt \,,
$$
obtaining the last equation in (@eq-frenet-positive-basis).

::: Theorem
### Frenet-Serret equations

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be unit-speed with $\kappa \neq 0$. The **Frenet-Serret** equations are
\begin{align*}  
\dot{\ttt} & = \kappa \nn \\
\dot{\nn} & = - \kappa \ttt + \tau \bb \\
\dot{\bb} & = -\tau \nn
\end{align*}
:::

::: Proof 

The first Frenet-Serret equation
$$
\dot{\ttt}  = \kappa \nn
$${#eq-proof-frenet-2}
is just the definition of $\nn$. The third Frenet-Serret equation
$$
\dot{\bb} = - \tau \nn
$${#eq-proof-frenet-3}
holds by Proposition \ref{proposition-binormal}. Now, recall that in Proposition \ref{proposition-positive-basis} we have proven
$$
\bb = \ttt \times \nn \,, \quad
\nn = \bb \times \ttt \,, \quad
\ttt = \nn \times \bb \,.
$${#eq-proof-frenet-1}
Differentiating the second equation in (@eq-proof-frenet-1) and using (@eq-proof-frenet-2)-(@eq-proof-frenet-3) we get
\begin{align*}
\dot{\nn} & = \dot{\bb} \times \ttt + \bb \times \dot{\ttt} & \\
          & = ( - \tau \nn \times \ttt) + \bb \times \kappa \nn \\
          & = \tau ( \ttt \times \nn ) - \kappa (\nn \times \bb ) \\
          & = \tau \bb - \kappa \ttt \,,
\end{align*}
where in the last equality we used the first and third equations in
(@eq-proof-frenet-1). The above is exactly the second Frenet-Serret equation.

:::


::: Remark
### Vectorial form of Frenet-Serret equations

We can write the Frenet-Serret ODE sysyem in vectorial form. To this end, introduce the (time-dependent) matrix
$$
F(t) : =
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & \kappa & 0 \\
- \kappa & 0 & \tau \\
0 & \tau & 0
\end{array}
\right) \,.
$$
It is immediate to check that the Frenet-Serret equations are equivalent to
$$
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
\dot{\ttt} \\
\dot{\nn} \\
\dot{\bb}
\end{array}
\right) 
= 
F 
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
\ttt \\
\nn \\
\bb
\end{array}
\right)  \,.
$$

**Note:** The matrix $F$ is anti-symmetric, that is
$$
F^T = - F \,.
$$
This observation will be crucial in proving the *Fundamental Theorem of Space Curves* in the next section.

## Fundamental Theorem of Space Curves

The most important consequence of the Frenet-Serret equations is that they allow to fully characterize space curves in terms of curvature and torsion. Precisely, the following theorem
holds.


::: Theorem
### Fundamental Theorem of Space Curves  {#theorem-characterization-space}


Let $\kappa, \tau \ \colon \R \to \R$ be smooth functions, with $\kappa>0$. Then:

1. There exists a unit-speed curve $\g \ \colon \R \to \R^3$ such that its curvature $\kappa^{\g}$ and torsion $\tau^{\g}$ satisfy
$$
\kappa^{\g}(t) = \kappa(t) \,, \quad 
\tau^{\g}(t) = \tau(t) \,,
  \,\, \forall \, t \in \R \,.
$$

2. Suppose that $\tg \ \colon \R \to \R^3$ is a unit-speed curve such that its curvature $\tilde{\kappa}^{\tg}$ and torsion $\tau^{\tg}$ satisfy
$$
\kappa^{\tg}(t) = \kappa(t) \,, \quad 
\tau^{\tg}(t) = \tau(t) 
  \,,\,\, \forall \, t \in \R \,.
$$
Then 
$$
\tg = \g
$$
up to rigid motions.

:::



The proof of Theorem \ref{theorem-characterization-space} is omitted, and it can be found in Theorem 2.3.6 in [@pressley]. 

Theorem \ref{theorem-characterization-space} is a very strong result. It is saying two things:

1. If we prescribe curvature and torsion, then there exists a unit-speed curve which has such curvature and torsion.

2. If two unit-speed curves have same curvature and torsion, then they must be the same curve, up to rigid motions.

In other words, curvature and torsion fully characterize space curves. This result is the 3D counterpart of
Theorem \ref{theorem-characterization-plane}, which said that signed curvature characterizes 
2D curves.



::: Example

In Example \ref{example-circle-rotated} we have considered the unit-speed curve
$$
\g(t) := \left( \frac45 \cos(t),  1 - \sin(t) , -\frac35 \cos(t)  \right) \,,
$$
for $t \in [0,2\pi]$. We have computed that 
$$
\kappa^{\g} = 1 \,, \quad \tau^{\g} = 0 \,. 
$$
If we plot $\g$, we clearly see that $\g$ is just obtained by translating and 
rotating a unit circle, see plot in @fig-circle-rigid. Theorem \ref{theorem-characterization-space} enables
us to rigorously prove this claim. Indeed, consider the unit-speed circle
$$
\tg(t) := \left( \cos(t), \sin(t) , 0  \right) \,,
$$
for $t \in [0,2\pi]$. In Example \ref{example-circle-curvature-torsion} we have proven that curvature and torsion are  
$$
\kappa^{\tg} = 1 \,, \quad \tau^{\tg} = 0 \,. 
$$
Therefore 
$$
\kappa^{\g} = \kappa^{\tg} \,, \quad \tau^{\g} = \tau^{\tg}  \,,
$$
and by Theorem  \ref{theorem-characterization-space} we conclude that $\g$ is equal to  $\tg$ up to rigid motions.

## Proving curvature and torsion formulae

Another consequence of the Frenet-Serret equations is that they allow us to finally 
prove the curvature and torsion formulas given in Proposition \ref{proposition-curvature-formula} and Proposition \ref{proposition-torsion-formula}. For reader's convenience we recall these two results.


::: Proposition 
### Curvature and torsion formulas  {#proposition-curvature-torsion-formulas}

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be a regular curve. The curvature $\kappa(t)$ of $\g$ at $\g(t)$ is given by
$$
\kappa(t) = \frac{ \norm{\dg \times \ddg} }{ \norm{\dg}^3 } \,. 
$$
Suppose in addition that $\g$ has non-vanishing curvature. The torsion $\tau(t)$ of $\g$ at $\g(t)$ is given by
$$
\tau (t) = \frac{ ( \dg \times \ddg ) \cdot \dddg }{ \norm{ \dg \times \ddg }^2 } \,. 
$$

:::


Before proceeding with the proof, we need to establish some notation.

::: Notation
### Compact notation for arc-length reparametrization

Suppose $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^n$ is regular and denote by 
$$
s \colon (a,b) \to (\tilde{a},\tilde{b})\,, \quad t \mapsto s(t)  
$$
its arc-length. We already know that in this case $s$ invertible, with inverse $s^{-1}$ giving a unit-speed reparametrization $\tg \colon (\tilde{a},\tilde{b}) \to \R^n$ of $\g$, defined by
$$
\tg = \g \circ \psi \,, \quad \psi:=s^{-1} \colon (\tilde{a},\tilde{b}) \to (a,b)
$$
Sometimes it is more convenient to adopt more compact notation. In the new notation the unit-speed 
reparametrization $\tg$ is denoted by $\g(s)$:
$$
t \mapsto \tg(t) \qquad \leadsto \qquad s \mapsto \g(s) \,.
$$
Thus, the reparametrization is denoted with the same symbol $\g$, but this time $\g$ is considered as
a function of the **arc-length parameter** 
$$
s \in (\tilde{a}, \tilde{b}) \,.
$$ 
We will denote:

- The derivative of $s$ by
$$
\frac{ds}{dt}
$$

- The derivative of $\psi = s^{-1}$ by
$$
\frac{dt}{ds} \,.
$$

Moreover:

- The derivative of $\g(t)$ is denoted by 
$$
\frac{d\g}{dt}(t) = \dg(t) \,, \quad  t \in (a,b)
$$

- The derivative of $\g(s)$ is denoted by
$$
\frac{d\g}{ds}(s) = \dg(s) \,, \quad  s \in (\tilde{a},\tilde{b}) \,.
$$

We also have new notations for the **chain rule**:

- The chain rule for $\g$ is the old notations is:
$$
\g(t) = \tg (s(t)) \quad  \implies \quad \dg(t) = \dtg(s(t)) \, \dot{s} (t) \,, \quad t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
In the new notations the above chain rule is written
$$
\frac{d\g}{dt}(t) = \frac{d\g}{ds}(s(t)) \, \frac{ds}{dt}(t) \,, \quad t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
We will often omit the dependence on the point $t$ by writing
$$
\frac{d\g}{ds} = \frac{d\g}{dt} \, \frac{dt}{ds} \,.
$$

- The chain rule for the reparametrization $\tg$ in the old notation is:
$$
\tg(t) = \g( \psi (t)) \quad \implies \quad \dtg(t) = \dg( \psi(t) ) \, \dot{\psi}(t) \,, \quad 
t \in (\tilde{a},\tilde{b}) \,.
$$
In the new notations the above chain rule is written
$$
\frac{d\g}{ds}(s) = \frac{d\g}{dt}( \psi(s) )  \, \frac{dt}{ds} ( s ) \,,\quad s \in (\ta,\tb) \,,
$$
since $\dot \psi$ is written $dt/ds$ in the new notations. 
Without dependence on the point $s$, the above reads
$$
\frac{d\g}{ds} = \frac{d\g}{dt} \, \frac{dt}{ds}  \,.
$$
:::


::: Example 
### How to use the new notations

Let $\g$ and $\tg$ be as above. We know that $\tg$ is unit-speed. Thus $\g(s)$ is unit-speed with respect to $s$, that is,
$$
\norm{\dg(s)} = 1\,, \quad \forall \, s \in (\tilde{a}, \tilde{b})  \,.
$${#eq-new-notations-1}
As an exercise, let us check that (@eq-new-notations-1) holds, using the new notations. By chain rule we have
\begin{align*}
\norm{\dg(s)} & = \norm{ \frac{d\g}{ds} (s) } \\
              & = \norm{\frac{d\g}{dt} (\psi(s))} \, \left| \frac{dt}{ds}(s) \right| \\
              & = \norm{\dg(\psi(s))} \, \left| \frac{dt}{ds}(s) \right| \,. 
\end{align*}
Now, recall that 
$$
\frac{ds}{dt}(t) = \dot{s}(t) = \norm{\dg (t)} \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$${#eq-new-notations-2}
According to the new notations and the inverse function theorem,
$$
\frac{dt}{ds}(s) = \frac{1}{\left(\dfrac{ds}{dt} (\psi(s)) \right)} = 
\frac{1}{\norm{\dg (\psi(s))}} \,, \quad \forall \, s \in (\tilde{a},\tilde{b}) \,,
$$
where we used (@eq-new-notations-2) evaluated at $t = \psi(s)$. Thus
\begin{align*}
\norm{\dg(s)} & = \norm{\dg(\psi(s))} \, \left| \frac{dt}{ds}(s) \right|  \\
              & = \norm{\dg(\psi(s))} \, \frac{1}{\norm{\dg(\psi(s))} }  \\
              & = 1 \,,
\end{align*}
concluding (@eq-new-notations-1).
:::

Let us highlight the main feature of the above notation.

::: Important
### New Notation!

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^n$ be a regular curve:

1. We denote by 
$$
t \mapsto \g(t)  \,, \quad t \in (a,b)
$$
the **given** curve $\g$.


2. We denote by 
$$
s \mapsto \g(s)  \,, \quad s \in (\tilde{a},\tilde{b})
$$
the **arc-length reparametrization** of the curve $\g$. The parameter $s$ is the 
**arc-length parameter**. In particular $\g(s)$ is unit-speed with respect to $s$. 

:::


We will heavily rely on the new notations for proving Proposition \ref{proposition-curvature-torsion-formulas}.

::: Proof
### Proof of Proposition \ref{proposition-curvature-torsion-formulas}

We only prove the formula for $\kappa$, as the one for $\tau$ can be obtained similarly, just with more calculations. For a proof see Proposition 2.3.1 in [@pressley].


Since $\g$ is regular, we can reparametrize $\g$ by arc-length $s(t)$. We denote the arc-length 
reparametrization by $\g(s)$. We know that $\g(s)$ is unit-speed, that is,
$$
\norm{  \frac{d\g}{ds}  } = 1 \,.
$$
Therefore is well
define the Frenet frame
$$
\{\ttt (s), \nn (s), \bb (s) \}  \,, \quad \ttt (s):=\dg(s) = \frac{d \g}{ds} (s)\,.
$$
The Frenet-Serret equations are
\begin{align*}
\dot{\ttt}(s) & = \kappa(s) \nn(s) \\
\dot{\nn}(s) & = -\kappa(s) \ttt(s) + \tau(s) \bb(s) \\
\dot{\bb}(s) & = - \tau(s) \nn(s) 
\end{align*}
By chain rule
$$
\frac{d \g}{dt} = \frac{d\g}{ds} \, \frac{ds}{dt} =\left( \frac{ds}{dt} \right) \, \ttt \,.
$$
Differentiating the above we infer
\begin{align*}
\frac{d^2 \g}{dt^2} & = \frac{d}{dt} \left[ \left( \frac{ds}{dt} \right) \, \ttt  \right] \\
                    & = \frac{d^2 s}{dt^2} \, \ttt +  \left( \frac{ds}{dt} \right) \, \frac{d\ttt}{dt}  \,. \\
\end{align*}
By chain rule we have
$$
 \frac{d\ttt}{dt}  =  \frac{d\ttt}{ds} \, \frac{dt}{ds} \,,
$$
and therefore 
\begin{align*}
\frac{d^2 \g}{dt^2} & = \frac{d^2 s}{dt^2} \, \ttt +  \left( \frac{ds}{dt} \right) \, \frac{d\ttt}{dt}  \\
   & = \frac{d^2 s}{dt^2} \, \ttt +  \left( \frac{ds}{dt} \right)^2 \, \frac{d\ttt}{ds} \,. 
\end{align*}
Hence
\begin{align*}
\dg(t) \times \ddg (t) & = \frac{d \g}{dt} \times  \frac{d^2 \g}{dt^2}  \\
& =   \left(\frac{ds}{dt} \right) \ttt \times  \left[  \frac{d^2 s}{dt^2} \, \ttt +  \left( \frac{ds}{dt} \right)^2 \, \frac{d\ttt}{ds}  \right] \\
& =  \left[ \left(\frac{ds}{dt} \right) \left(\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} \right)  \ttt \times \ttt \right] +
     \left[ \left( \frac{ds}{dt} \right)^3  \,\, \ttt \times \frac{d\ttt}{ds} \right] \\
& =  \left( \frac{ds}{dt} \right)^3  \,\, \ttt \times \frac{d\ttt}{ds} \,,
\end{align*}
since $\ttt \times \ttt = 0$ by the properties of the cross product. Now we recall that 
$$
\frac{d\ttt}{ds} = \kappa(s) \, \nn(s)
$$
by the first Frenet-Serret equation. Moreover
$$
\frac{ds}{dt}(t) = \norm{  \dg(t) }^2 \,.
$$
Therefore
\begin{align*}
\dg(t) \times \ddg (t) & = \left( \frac{ds}{dt} \right)^3  \,\, \ttt \times \frac{d\ttt}{ds} \\
                       & = \norm{ \dg (t) }^3 \, \kappa(s(t)) \,\, \ttt \times \nn \\
                       & = \norm{ \dg (t) }^3 \, \kappa(s(t)) \,\, \bb \,,
\end{align*}
where in the last line we used the definition of $\bb$
$$
\bb(s) = \dg(s) \times \nn(s) = \ttt(s) \times \nn(s) \,. 
$$
We can now take the norms and obtain
\begin{align*}
\norm{\dg(t) \times \ddg (t)} & = \norm{ \dg (t) }^3 \, \kappa(s(t)) \,  \norm{\bb} \\
                              & = \norm{ \dg (t) }^3 \, \kappa(s(t)) 
\end{align*}
using that $\norm{\bb} = 1$. As $\g$ is regular, we can divide by $\norm{\dg(t)}^3$ and obtain
$$
\kappa(s (t)) = \frac{\norm{\dg(t) \times \ddg (t)}}{\norm{ \dg (t) }^3} \,.
$$
Recalling that the curvature of $\g$ at $t$ is defined as the curvature of $\g(s)$ at $s(t)$, we conclude that the above is the desired formula.

## Rigidity results


We now state and prove two more results which directly follow from the Frenet-Serret equations. They state, respectivley:

1. A curve has torsion $\tau = 0$ if and only if it is contained in a plane.

2. A curve has constant curvature and zero torsion if and only if it is part of a circle.


Before proceeding, we recall the following.



::: Remark
### Equation of a plane

The general equation of a plane $\pmb{\pi}_d$ in $\R^3$ is given by

$$
\pmb{\pi}_d = \{ \xx \in \R^3 \, \colon \,  \xx \cdot \mathbf{P} = d \}\,,
$$
for some vector $\mathbf{P} \in \R^3$ and scalar $d \in \R$. Note that:

- If $d = 0$, the condition
$$
\xx \cdot \mathbf{P} = 0
$$
is saying that the plane $\pmb{\pi}_0$ contains all the points $\xx$ in $\R^3$ which are orthogonal to $\mathbf{P}$. In particular $\pmb{\pi}_0$ contains the origin $\zero$. 

- If $d \neq 0$, then $\pmb{\pi}_d$ is the translation of $\pmb{\pi}_0$ by the quantity $d$ in direction $\mathbf{P}$.

 In both cases, $\mathbf{P}$ is the normal vector to the plane, as shown in @fig-general-plane below.
:::


![The plane $\pmb{\pi}_0$ is the set of points of $\R^3$ orthogonal to $\mathbf{P}$. The plane $\pmb{\pi}_d$ is obtained by translating $\pmb{\pi}_0$ by a quantity $d$ in direction $\mathbf{P}$.](/images/general_plane.png){#fig-general-plane width=70%}





::: {.Proposition  #proposition-zero-torsion}

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be regular and such that $\kappa \neq 0$. They are equivalent:


1. The torsion of $\g$ satisfies $\tau(t) = 0$ for all $t \in (a,b)$.

2. The image of $\g$ is contained in a plane, that is, there exists a vector $\mathbf{P} \in \R^3$ and a scalar $d \in \R$ such that
$$
\g(t)\cdot \mathbf{P} = d \,, \quad \forall t \in (a,b) \,.
$$


:::



::: Proof
Without loss of generality we can assume that $\g$ is unit-speed. Indeed, if we were to consider $\tg$ a unit-speed reparametrization of $\g$, then

- $\tg$ is still contained in the same plane as $\g$ is contained.
- Torsion is invariant under reparametrization. Thus $\tg$ has still zero torsion.

As $\g$ is unit-speed, it possesses the Frenet frame
$$
\{ \dg(t), \nn(t) ,\bb(t) \} \,.
$$


*Step 1.* Suppose $\tau = 0$ for all $t$. By the Frenet-Serret equations
$$
\dot{\bb} = -\tau(t) \nn = \zero \,,
$$
so that $\bb(t)$ is constant. As by definition 
$$
\bb = \dg \times \nn \,,
$$ 
we conclude that the vectors $\dg(t)$ and $\nn(t)$ always span the same plane, which has constant normal vector $\bb$. Intuition suggests that $\g$ should be contained in such plane, see Figure @fig-proof-plane below. Indeed, recall that the Frenet frame is orthonormal. Hence
$$
\dg \cdot \bb \equiv 0  \quad \implies \quad 
\frac{d}{dt} ( \g \cdot \bb ) = \dg \cdot \bb + \g \cdot \dot{\bb} = 0\,,
$$
since $\dot{\bb}=0$. Thus $\g \cdot \bb$ is a constant scalar function, and so there exists $d \in \R$ such that
$$
\g(t) \cdot \bb = d \,, \,\, \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
As the above equation holds for each $t$, we can fix an arbitrary $t_0 \in (a,b)$ and
find that the constant
$$
d = \g(t_0) \cdot \bb 
$$
Hence we obtain
$$
(\g(t) - \g(t_0)) \cdot \bb = 0 \,, \,\, \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
The above is says that $\g$ is contained in the plane (orthogonal to $\bb$) with equation
$$
(\xx - \g(t_0)) \cdot \bb = 0
$$
This concludes the first part of the proof.



*Step 2.* Suppose that $\g$ is contained in a plane. Hence there exists $\mathbf{P} \in \R^3$ and $d \in \R$ such that 
$$
\g(t)\cdot \mathbf{P} = d \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
We can differentiate the above equation twice to obtain
$$
\dg \cdot \mathbf{P} = 0 \,, \quad   \ddg \cdot \mathbf{P} = 0 \,,
$$
where we used that $\mathbf{P}$ and $d$ are constant.
By Frenet-Serret we have
$$
\ddg (t)= \kappa (t) \nn (t) \,.
$$
Therefore the already proven relation $\ddg \cdot \mathbf{P} = 0$ implies
$$
\kappa (t) \nn (t) \cdot \mathbf{P} = 0 \,.
$$
As we are assuming $\kappa \neq 0$, we deduce that
$$
\nn (t) \cdot \mathbf{P} = 0 \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
We have shown that $\dg(t)$ and $\nn(t)$ are both orthogonal to $\mathbf{P}$. Since $\bb(t)$ is orthogonal to both $\dg(t)$ and $\nn(t)$, we conclude that $\bb(t)$ is parallel to $\mathbf{P}$. Hence, there exists $\lambda(t) \in \R$ such that
$$
\bb(t) = \lambda(t) \mathbf{P} \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
Since $\norm{\bb} = 1$ and $\mathbf{P}$ is constant, from (@eq-proof-plane) we conclude that $\lambda(t)$ is constant
and non-zero. In particular we have proven that $\bb$ is parallel to $\mathbf{P}$, i.e.,
$$
\bb(t) = \hat{\lambda} \mathbf{P} \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,,
$${#eq-proof-plane}
for some $\hat{\lambda} \neq 0$. Differentiating (@eq-proof-plane) we obtain
$$
\dot{\bb}(t) = 0 \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,,
$$
meaning that the binormal $\bb$ is a constant vector. By definition of torsion we thus have
$$
\tau(t) = - \dot{\bb} \cdot \nn(t) = 0 \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,,
$$
as required.

As a corollary of Step 1 in the proof of Proposition \ref{proposition-zero-torsion}
we obtain the following statement.


::: {.Corollary  #corollary-zero-torsion}

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be regular and such that $\kappa \neq 0$. Suppose that
the torsion
$$
\tau(t) = 0 \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b)\,.
$$
Then the image of $\g$ is contained in the plane of
equation
$$
(\xx - \g(t_0)) \cdot \bb = 0 \,,
$$
where $t_0 \in (a,b)$ is arbitrarily chosen. Note that such plane is orthogonal to the binormal $\bb$.

::: Example 

Consider again the curve of Example \ref{example-circle-rotated}
$$
\g(t) := \left( \frac45 \cos(t),  1 - \sin(t) , -\frac35 \cos(t)  \right) \,,
$$
for $t \in \R$. Recall that $\g$ is a Circle which has been rotated an translated, as shown in @fig-circle-rigid. We have
already proven in Example \ref{example-circle-rotated} that the curvature and torsion satisfy
$$
\kappa = 1 \,, \qquad \tau = 0 \,.  
$$
Since $\kappa \neq 0$ and $\tau=0$, we can apply Corollary \ref{corollary-zero-torsion} and infer that $\g$ is contained in the plane of equation
$$
	(\xx - \g(t_0)) \cdot \bb = 0 \,, \quad \xx \in \R^3 \,,
$$
where $\bb$ is the binormal vector to $\g$. As computed in Example \ref{example-circle-rotated} we have
$$
\bb =  \left( -\frac35, 0, -\frac45 \right) \,.
$$
Next, we take a point on the curve. At $t = 0$ we have
$$
\g(0) = \left( \frac45, 1, -\frac35 \right)
$$
The equation of the plane is then
$$
-\frac{3}{5} \left(x - \frac45 \right) -  \frac{4}{5} \left( z + \frac{3}{5} \right) = 0.
$$
Simplifying, we obtain that the equation of the plane containing $\g$ is
$$
3x + 4z = 0 \, .
$$

We now state and prove the second result anticipated at the beginning of this section.


::: {.Proposition #proposition-constant-k-zero-t}

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be a unit-speed curve. They are equivalent:


1. The image of $\g$ is contained in a circle of radius $1/c$.


2. The curvature and torsion of $\g$ satisfy
$$
\kappa (t) = c \,, \quad  \tau(t) = 0\,,  \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b)\,, 
$$
for some constant $c \in \R$.


:::


Proposition \ref{proposition-constant-k-zero-t} is actually a consequence of Theorem 
\ref{theorem-characterization-space}, and of the fact that we have computed 
that for a circle of radius $R$ one has
$$
\kappa  = \frac1R \,, \quad  \tau = 0\,.
$$
Therefore, by Theorem \ref{theorem-characterization-space}, every unit-speed curve $\g$ with
constant curvature and torsion must be equal to a circle, up to rigid motions. 

Nevertheless, we still give a proof of Proposition \ref{proposition-constant-k-zero-t}, 
to show yet another explicit application of the Frenet-Serret equations.


::: Proof
*Step 1.* Suppose the image of $\g$ is contained in a circle of radius $1/c$. Then, up to a translation, $\g$ is parametrized by 
$$
\g(t) = \left( \frac{1}{c} \cos(t) ,   \frac{1}{c} \sin(t) , 0 \right) 
$$
for $t$ in some interval $(\tilde{a},\tilde{b})$. We have already seen that in this case
$$
\kappa = c  \,, \quad \tau = 0 \,,
$$
concluding the proof.


*Step 2.* Suppose that 
$$
\kappa (t) = c \,, \quad  \tau(t) = 0\,,  \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b)\,, 
$$
for some constant $c \in \R$. Since $\g$ is unit-speed, its Frenet-Serret equations are:
\begin{align*}
\ddg & = \kappa \nn = c \nn \\
\dot{\nn} & = - \kappa \dg + \tau \bb = -c \dg \\
\dot{\bb} & = -\tau \nn = 0  
\end{align*}
In particular $\dot{\bb}=0$ and so $\bb$ is a constant vector. As seen in the proof Proposition \ref{proposition-zero-torsion}, this implies that $\g$ is contained in a plane $\p$ orthogonal to $\bb$, see @fig-proof-plane. As $c$ is constant we get
$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left(  \g  + \frac1c \nn   \right)  = \dg + \frac{1}{c} \dot{\nn} = \dg - \frac1c 
\, c \dg = 0 \,,
$$
where we used the second Frenet-Serret equation. Therefore 
$$ 
\g(t)  + \frac1c \nn(t) = \pp \,, \quad  t \in (a,b) \,,
$$
for some constant point $\pp \in \R^3$. In particular
$$
\norm{ \g(t) - \pp } =   \norm{  -\frac1c \nn(t) } = \frac1c \,,
$$
since $\nn$ is a unit vector. The above shows that $\g$ is contained in a sphere of radius $1/c$ and center $\pp$. In formulas:
$$
\g((a,b) ) \subset \SSS := \{  \xx \in \R^3 \, \colon \,  \norm{\xx - \pp} = 1/c    \} \,.
$$
The intersection of $\SSS$ with the plane $\p$ is a circle $\mathcal{C}$ with some radius $R$. Since 
$$
\g((a,b) ) \subset \p \,, \quad \g((a,b) ) \subset \SSS \,,
$$
this implies 
$$
\g((a,b) ) \subset  \p  \cap \SSS  = \mathcal{C} \,.
$${#eq-proof-contained-circle}
Thus $\g$ parametrizes part of $\mathcal{C}$. From Step 1 it follows that the curvature and torsion of $\g$ must satisfy
$$
\kappa = \frac1R \,, \quad \tau = 0 \,.
$$
Since we already know that $\kappa=c$, we conclude that $R=1/c$. Therefore the circle $\mathcal{C}$ has radius $1/c$ and the thesis follows by (@eq-proof-contained-circle).
