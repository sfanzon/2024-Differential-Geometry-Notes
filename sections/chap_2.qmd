# Curvature and Torsion

We have seen how to describe curves and reparametrized them. Now we want to look at local properties of curves:

- How much does a curve twist?
- How much does a curve bend?

We will measure two quantities:

- **Curvature**: measures how much a curve $\g$ deviates from a straight line.
- **Torsion**: measures how much a curve $\g$ deviates from a plane.

For example a 2D spiral is curved, but still lies in a plane. Instead the Helix both deviates from a straight line and *pulls away* from any fixed plane. 



## Curvature 

We start with an informal discussion. Suppose $\g$ is a straight line
$$
\g(t) = \mathbf{a} + t \mathbf{v}
$$
with $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{v} \in \R^3$. Whichever the definition of curvature will be,
we expect the curvature of a straight line to be zero. The tangent vector to $\g$ is constant
$$
\dg(t) =  \mathbf{v} \,.
$$
If we further derive the tangent vector, we obtain
$$
\ddg(t) =  \zero \,.
$$
Thus $\ddg$ seems to be a good candidate for the definition of curvature of $\g$ at the point $\g(t)$.  


Suppose now that $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^2$ is a **planar curve** with unit-speed. We have proven that in this case
$$
\dg \cdot \ddg = 0 \,,
$$
that is, the vector $\ddg$ is orthogonal to the tangent $\dg$ at all times. Now let $\mathbf{n}(t)$ be the unit vector orthogonal to $\dg(t)$ at the point $\g(t)$. The amount that the curve $\g$ deviates from its tangent at $\g(t)$ after time $t_0$ is
$$
[ \g(t + t_0) - \g(t) ] \cdot \mathbf{n}(t) \,,
$$ {#eq-curvature-heuristics}
as seen in Figure @fig-curvature.


![Amount that $\g$ deviates from tangent is $[\g(t+t_0)-\g(t)] \cdot \nn(t)$](/images/curvature.png){#fig-curvature width=70%}


Equation (@eq-curvature-heuristics) is what we take as measure of curvature. Since 
$$
\dg(t) \cdot \ddg(t) = 0 \quad \mbox{ and } \quad   \dg(t) \cdot \mathbf{n}(t)= 0 \,,
$$
we conclude that $\ddg(s)$ is parallel to $\mathbf{n}(t)$. Since $\mathbf{n}(t)$ is a unit vector, there exists a scalar $\kappa(t)$ such that 
$$
\ddg(t)  = \kappa(t) \, \mathbf{n}(t) \,.
$$
Taking the norms of the above and recalling that $\norm{\nn} = 1$ gives
$$
\kappa(t) = \norm{ \ddg(t) }
$$
Now, approximate $\g$ at $t$ with its second order Taylor polynomial:
$$
\g(t+t_0) = \g(t) + \dg(t) t_0 + \frac{\ddg(t)}{2} t_0^2 + o(t_0^2)
$$
where the remainder $o(t_0^2)$ is such that 
$$
\lim_{t_0 \to 0} \ \frac{o(t_0^2)}{t_0^2} = 0 \,.
$$
Therefore, discarding the remainder, 
$$
\g(t+t_0) - \g(t) \approx \dg(t) t_0 + \frac{\ddg(t)}{2} t_0^2 \,.
$$
Multiplying by $\nn(t)$ we get
$$
(\g(t+t_0) - \g(t)) \cdot \nn(t) \approx \dg(t) \cdot \nn(t) t_0 + 
\frac{\ddg(t) \cdot \nn(t) }{2} t_0^2\,.
$$
Recalling that 
$$
\dg(t) \cdot \nn(t) = 0\,, \quad  \ddg(t) \cdot \nn(t) = \kappa(t) \,, 
$$
we then obtain
$$
[\g(t + t_0) - \g(t) ] \cdot \nn(t) \approx 
\frac{1}{2} \, \kappa(t) \, t_0^2
$$


::: Important

The amount that $\g$ deviates from a straight line is proportional to 
$$
\kappa(t) = \norm{\ddg (t)}\,.
$$

:::

We take this as definition of curvature for a general unit-speed curve in $\R^n$.


::: Definition 
### Curvature of unit-speed curve

Let $\g \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^n$ be a unit-speed curve. The **curvature** of $\g$ at $\g(t)$ is
$$
\kappa(t) := \norm{\ddg (t)} \,.
$$

:::



Note that $\kappa(t)$ is a function of the parameter $t$: The curvature of $\g$ can change from point to point.



::: Example
### Curvature of the circle

We have seen that the arc-length parametrization of the circle of center
$(x_0,y_0)$ and radius $R>0$ is
$$
\g(t) =  \left( x_0 + R \cos \left( \frac{t}{R} \right), y_0 + \sin \left( \frac{t}{R} \right) \right) 
$$
As $\g$ is parametrized by arc-length, we have that $\g$ is unit-speed.
To compute the curvature we need the second derivative $\ddg$
\begin{align*}
\dg (t) & =  \left( - \sin \left( \frac{t}{R} \right) ,  \cos \left( \frac{t}{R} \right)\right) \\
\ddg (t) & =  \left( -\frac{1}{R} \cos \left( \frac{t}{R} \right) ,  - \frac{1}{R} \sin \left( \frac{t}{R} \right)\right)
\end{align*}
Therefore the curvature of $\g$ is
$$
\kappa(t) = \norm{ \ddg (t) } = \frac{1}{R} \,.
$$
In this case $\kappa$ is constant. The above formula also tells us that
the curvature is inversely proportional to the radius of the circle: A large circle will look (locally) almost like a straight line.

:::



**Question:** How do we define curvature for arbitrary curves?

**Answer:** When $\g$ is regular we can use unit-speed reparametrizations to define $\kappa$.



::: Definition 
### Curvature of regular curve {#definition-curvature}

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be a regular curve and $\tg$ be a unit-speed reparametrization of 
$\g$, with 
$$
\g = \tg \circ \phi \,,  \quad \f \colon  (a,b) \to (\tilde{a},\tilde{b})  \,.
$$
Denote by
$$
\tkappa \colon (\tilde{a},\tilde{b}) \to \R \,, \qquad \tkappa(t) :=   \norm{\ddtg (t)}
$$
the curvature of $\tg$. The **curvature** of $\g$ at $\g(t)$ is defined by
$$
\kappa(t) := \tkappa(\f(t))
$$

:::

In order for the above definition to make sense, 
we need to check that the curvature $\kappa$ does not change if we choose a different unit-speed reparametrization.
This is shown in the next Proposition. 


::: Proposition
### $\kappa$ is invariant for unit-speed reparametrization {#proposition-curvature-invariant}

Consider the setting of Definition \ref{definition-curvature}.
If $\hat{\g}$ is another unit-speed reparametrization of $\g$, with $\g = \hat{\g} \circ \psi$, then
$$
\kappa(t) = \tkappa ( \f(t) ) = \hat{\kappa}(\psi(t)) \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b)
$$
where 
$$
\hat{\kappa}(t) := \norm{ \ddot{\hat{ \g }}(t) }
$$
is the curvature of $\hat{\g}$. 

:::


::: Proof
Since $\tg$ and $\hat{\g}$ are both reparametrizations of $\g$
$$
\tg(  \f(t)) = \g(t) = \hat{\g} (\psi(t)  ) 
$$
Using that $\f$ is invertible we obtain
$$
{\tg}(t) = \hat\g(\xi(t))\,, \quad \xi := \psi \circ \f^{-1} \,,
$${#eq-well-posed-curvature-3}
and $\xi$ is a diffeomorphism, being composition of diffeomorphisms. 
Differentiating (@eq-well-posed-curvature-3)
$$
\dtg(t) = \dot{\hat{\g}}(\xi(t)) \dot\xi(t) \,.
$${#eq-well-posed-curvature-2}
Taking the norms and recalling that $\tg$ and $\hat\g$ are unit-speed, we get
$$
|\dot\xi(t)| = 1 \,, \quad  \forall \, t \,. 
$$
Since $\dot\xi$ is continuous we infer 
$$
\dot\xi(t) \equiv 1 \quad \mbox{or} \quad
\dot\xi(t) \equiv -1 \,.
$$
In both cases
$$
\ddot \xi \equiv 0 \,.
$$
Differentiating (@eq-well-posed-curvature-2) we then obtain
\begin{align*}
\ddtg(t) & = \ddot{\hat{\g}}(\xi(t)) \dot\xi^2(t) + 
                         \dot{\hat{\g}}(\xi(t)) \ddot\xi (t) \\
                  & = \ddot{\hat{\g}}(\xi(t)) \dot\xi^2(t) \,,
\end{align*}
where we used that $\ddot{\xi} = 0$.
Taking the norms and using again that $|\dot\xi| \equiv 1$ 
$$
\norm{  \ddtg(t)} = \norm{ \ddot{\hat{\g}}(\xi(t))} \,.
$$
Recalling that $\xi  = \psi \circ \f^{-1}$ and the definitions of $\tkappa$ and $\hat{\kappa}$ we conclude
$$
\tkappa ( \f(t) ) = \norm{  \ddtg( \f(t))} = \norm{ \ddot{\hat{\g}}(\psi(t))} = \hat{\kappa} ( \psi(t) ) \,.
$$

::: Remark 
### Method for computing curvature

In summary, the curvature of a regular curve 
$$
\g \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^n
$$ 
is defined via unit-speed reparametrizations of $\g$. To compute $\kappa$ we do the following: 

1. Find a unit-speed reparametrization $\tg$ of the regular curve $\g$

2. This can be done by computing $s$ the arc-length of $\g$, and then defining the arc-length reparametrization
$$
\tg:= \g \circ s^{-1}
$$

3. Compute curvature of $\tg$
$$
\tkappa(s) = \norm{\ddtg (s)}
$$

4. The curvature of $\g$ at $\g(t)$ is
$$
\kappa (t)= \tkappa (s(t)) 
$$

:::


::: Important

When $\g$ is regular and has values in $\R^3$, there is a way to compute $\kappa$ without reparametrizing. To see this, we will first need the notion of **cross product**, or **vector product**.

:::




Before proceeding with the next example, let us give a short overview of the **Hyperbolic functions**.
 

::: Remark 
### Hyperbolic functions    {#remark-hyperbolic-functions}

The Hyperbloic functions are the analogous of the trigonometric functions, but defined using the hyperbola rather than the circle. Their formulas can be obtained by means of the exponential function $e^t$. We have:


- Hyperbolic cosine: The **even part** of the function $e^t$, that is, 
$$
\cosh (t) = \frac {e^t + e^{-t}} {2} = \frac {e^{2t} + 1} {2e^t} = \frac {1 + e^{-2t}} {2e^{-t}} \,.
$$

- Hyperbolic sine: The **odd part** of the function $e^t$, that is, 
$$
\sinh (t) = \frac {e^t - e^{-t}} {2} = \frac {e^{2t} - 1} {2e^t} = \frac {1 - e^{-2t}} {2e^{-t}} \,.
$$

- Hyperbolic tangent: Defined by
$$
\tanh(t) = \frac{\sinh t}{\cosh t} = \frac {e^t - e^{-t}} {e^t + e^{-t}}
= \frac{e^{2t} - 1} {e^{2t} + 1} \,.
$$

- Hyperbolic cotangent: The reciprocal of $\tanh$ for $t \neq 0$,
$$
\coth t = \frac{\cosh t}{\sinh t} = \frac {e^t + e^{-t}} {e^t - e^{-t}}
= \frac{e^{2t} + 1} {e^{2t} - 1} \,.
$$

- Hyperbolic secant: The reciprocal of $\cosh$
$$
\sech (t) = \frac{1}{\cosh t} = \frac {2} {e^t + e^{-t}}
= \frac{2e^t} {e^{2t} + 1} \,.
$$

* Hyperbolic cosecant: The reciprocal of $\sinh$ for $t \neq 0$,
$$
\csch (t) = \frac{1}{\sinh t} = \frac {2} {e^t - e^{-t}}
= \frac{2e^t} {e^{2t} - 1} \,.
$$

For a plot $\cosh, \sinh, \tanh$ see @fig-hyperbolic-functions below. The properties of the
hyperbolic functions which are of interest to us are:

1. Identities: 
\begin{align*}
&\cosh(t) + \sinh(t) = e^t \\
&\cosh(t) - \sinh(t) = e^{-t} \\
&\cosh^2(t) - \sinh^2(t)  = 1 \\
&{\sech}^2(t) - \tanh^2(t)  = 1  
\end{align*}

2. Derivatives: 
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dt} \left[ \sinh(t) \right] & = \cosh (t) \\
\frac{d}{dt} \left[ \cosh(t) \right] & = \sinh (t) \\
\frac{d}{dt} \left[ \tanh(t) \right] & = 1 - \tanh^2 (t) = - {\csch}^2(t) 
\end{align*}

3. Integrals: 
\begin{align*}
\int_{t_0}^t \sinh(u) \, du & = \cosh (t) - \cosh( t_0 ) \\
\int_{t_0}^t \cosh(u) \, du & = \sinh (t) - \sinh( t_0 ) \\
\int_{t_0}^t \tanh(u) \, du & = \log ( \cosh (t) ) - \log ( \cosh (t_0) )
\end{align*}

::: Example
### The Catenary

The **catenary** is the shape of a heavy chain suspended at its ends. The chain is only subjected to gravity, see @fig-catenary. This shape looks similar to a parabola, but it is not a parabola. This was first noted by Galilei, see this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenary). The profile of the hanging chain can be obtained via a minimization problem, and one can show it is of the form 
$$
\g(t) = ( t, \cosh(t) ) \,, \quad t \in \R \,.
$$
See @fig-catenary-plot for a plot of $\g$. Let us check if $\g$ is regular. We have
$$
\dg (t) = (1 , \sinh(t)) 
$$
so that
$$
\norm{ \dg }^2 = 1 + {\sinh}^2 (t) = \cosh^2 (t) 
\quad \implies \quad
\norm{ \dg } = \cosh (t) \,. 
$$
Note that 
$$
\cosh(t) \geq 1
$$
showing that $\g$ is regular. However
$$
\norm{\dg(1)} = \cosh (1) = \frac{e + e^{-1}}{2} \approx 1.54 \,, 
$$
proving that $\g$ is not unit-speed. Let us then compute the arc-length of $\g$ starting at $t_0 = 0$
$$
s(t) = \int_0^t \norm{ \dg (u) } \, du =  \int_0^t \cosh (u) \, du = \sinh (t)
$$
where we used that $\sinh(0) = 0$. We need to invert $s$. We have
\begin{align*}
s = \sinh(t) \quad & \iff \quad s = \frac{e^t - e^{-t}}{2} \\
             \quad & \iff \quad e^{2t} - 2s e^{t} - 1 = 0\,,
\end{align*}
where the last equation was obtained by rearranging and multiplying both sides by $e^t$. Now we substitute
$$
y = e^t
$$
and obtain
\begin{align*}
e^{2t} - 2s e^{t} - 1 = 0 \quad & \iff \quad y^{2} - 2s y - 1 = 0 \\
                           \quad & \iff \quad y_{\pm} = s \pm \sqrt{1+s^2} \,.
\end{align*}
Notice that
$$
y_{+} = s + \sqrt{1 + s^2} \geq s + \sqrt{s^2} = s + |s| \geq 0
$$
by definition of absolute value. As we were looking for $y$ in the form $y=e^t$, we only consider the positive solution $y_+$. Then
$$
e^t = y_+ = s + \sqrt{1 + s^2 } \quad \implies \quad t = \log \left( s + \sqrt{1 + s^2} \right) \,.
$$
We have proven that the inverse of the arc-length $s(t)$ is 
$$
\psi(s) = t(s) = \log \left( s + \sqrt{ 1+ s^2} \right) \,.
$$
Therefore the arc-length reparametrization of $\g$ is
$$
\tg (s) := \g( t(s) ) = \left(  \log \left( s + \sqrt{ 1+ s^2} \right) , \sqrt{1 + s^2}  \right) \,.
$$
We can now compute the curvature. We have:
\begin{align*}
\dtg (s) &  = \left(  \frac{1}{ \sqrt{1 + s^2} } , \frac{s}{ \sqrt{1 + s^2}}   \right) \\
\ddtg (s) & = \left( - \frac{s}{ (1 + s^2)^{3/2} } , \frac{1}{(1 + s^2)^{3/2} }   \right)
\end{align*}
Hence
$$
\norm{\ddtg (s)}^2 = \frac{s^2}{(1+s^2)^3} + \frac{1}{(1+s^2)^3} = \frac{1}{(1+s^2)^2} \,.
$$
Therefore the curvature of $\tg$ is
$$
\tkappa(s) = \norm{\ddtg (s)}= \frac{1}{1+s^2} \,.
$$
Recalling that $s(t) = \sinh(t)$, we conclude that the curvature of $\g$ is
$$
\kappa (t) = \tkappa(s(t)) = \frac{1}{1+ \sinh(t)^2} = 
\frac{1}{\cosh(t)^2}
$$
where we used the identity $1 + \sinh^2 = \cosh^2$.

## Vector product in $\R^3$


The discussion in this section follows [@do-carmo]. We start by defining **orientation** for a vector space.


::: Definition
### Same orientation

Consider two ordered basis of $\R^3$
$$
B = (\bb_1,\bb_2,\bb_3) \,, \quad \tilde{B} = (\widetilde{\bb}_1,\widetilde{\bb}_2,\widetilde{\bb}_3) \,.
$$
We say that $B$ and $\widetilde{B}$ have the same orientation if the matrix of change of basis has positive determinant, that is, if 
$$
\det P > 0
$$
where $P \in \R^{3 \times 3}$ is such that
$$
\tilde{B} = P^{-1} B P \,.
$$

:::

When two basis $B$ and $\widetilde{B}$ have the same orientation, we write
$$
B \sim \widetilde{B} \,.
$$
The above is clearly an equivalence relation on the set of ordered basis. Therefore the set of ordered basis of $\R^3$ can be decomposed into equivalence classes.
Since the determinant of the matrix of change of basis can only be positive or negative, there are only two equivalence classes.


::: Definition 
### Orientation

The two equivalence classes determined by $\sim$ on the set of ordered basis are called **orientations**. 

:::



::: Definition 
### Positive orientation

Consider the standard basis of $\R^3$ 
$$
E = (\ee_1,\ee_2,\ee_3)
$$
where we set
$$
\ee_1 = (1,0,0)\,, \quad \ee_2 = (0,1,0) \,, \quad \ee_3 = (0,0,1) \,.
$$
Then:

- The orientation corresponding to $E$ is called **positive orientation** of $\R^3$.
- The orientation corresponding to the other equivalence class is called **negative orientation** of $\R^3$.


For a basis $B$ of $\R^3$ we say that:

- $B$ is a **positive basis** if it belongs to the class of $E$.
- $B$ is a **negative basis** if it does not belong to the class of $E$.
:::



::: Example

Since we are dealing with ordered basis, the order in which vectors appear is fundamental. For example, we defined the equivalence class of
$$
E = (\ee_1,\ee_2,\ee_3) \,,
$$
to be the positive orientation of $\R^3$. In particular $e$ is a positive basis.  
Consider instead
$$
\widetilde{E} = (\ee_2,\ee_1,\ee_3) \,.
$$
The matrix of change of variables between $\widetilde{E}$ and $E$ is 
$$
P = (\ee_2 | \ee_1 | \ee_3 ) = \left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & 1 & 0 \\ 
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{array}
\right)
$$
and clearly
$$
\det P = - 1 < 0 \,.
$$
Thus $\widetilde{E}$ does not belong to the class of $E$, and is therefore a negative basis. 
:::


We are now ready to define the vector product in $\R^3$.


::: Definition
### Vector product in $\R^3$   

Let $\uu,\vv \in \R^3$. The vector product of $\uu$ and $\vv$ is the unique vector 
$$
\uu \times \vv \in \R^3
$$
which satisfies the property:
$$
(\uu \times \vv) \cdot \ww = 
\left|
\begin{array}{ccc}
u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\
v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \\
w_1 & w_2 & w_3 \\
\end{array}
\right| \,, \quad \forall \, \ww \in \R^3 \,.
$${#eq-def-vector-product}
Here $|A|$ denotes the determinant of the matrix $A = (a_{ij})_{ij}$, and 
$u_i$, $v_i$, $w_i$ are the components of $\uu$, $\vv$, $\ww$, i.e.
$$
\uu= \sum_{i=1}^3 u_i \ee_i \,, \quad

\ww= \sum_{i=1}^3 w_i \ee_i \,,
$$
with $(\ee_1,\ee_2,\ee_3)$ standard basis of $\R^3$.
:::


The following proposition gives an explicit formula for computing $\uu \times \vv$.


::: Proposition

Let $\uu,\vv \in \R^3$. Then
$$
\uu \times \vv =

u_1 & u_2  \\
v_1 & v_2

\right| \ee_3  \,. 
$$ {#eq-formula-cross-product}
:::




::: Proof
Denote by $(\uu \times \vv)_i$ the $i$-th component of $\uu \times \vv$ with respect to the standard basis, that is,
$$
\uu \times \vv = \sum_{i=1}^3  (\uu \times \vv)_i \, \ee_i \,.
$$
We can use (@eq-def-vector-product) with $\ww = \ee_1$ to obtain 
$$
(\uu \times \vv) \cdot \ee_1  = 
\left|
\begin{array}{ccc}
u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\
v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \\

\end{array}
\right| =
\left|
\begin{array}{cc}
u_2 & u_3  \\
v_2 & v_3 
\end{array}
\right|
$$
where we used the Laplace expansion for computing the determinant of the $3 \times 3$ matrix. As the standard basis is orthonormal, by bilinearity of the scalar product we get
$$
(\uu \times \vv) \cdot \ee_1 = \sum_{i=1}^3  (\uu \times \vv)_i \, \ee_i \cdot \ee_1 = (\uu \times \vv)_i \,.
$$
Therefore we have shown
$$
(\uu \times \vv)_1 = \left|
\begin{array}{cc}
u_2 & u_3  \\
v_2 & v_3 
\end{array}
\right| \,.
$$
Similarly we obtain
$$
(\uu \times \vv)_2  = \left|
\begin{array}{ccc}
u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\
v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \\
 0  & 1   &   0 \\
\end{array}
\right| = -
\left|
\begin{array}{cc}
u_1 & u_3  \\
v_1 & v_3 
\end{array}
\right|
$$
and 
$$
(\uu \times \vv)_3  = \left|
\begin{array}{ccc}
u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\
v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \\
 0  & 0   &   1 \\
\end{array}
\right| = 
\left|
\begin{array}{cc}
u_1 & u_2  \\
v_1 & v_2 
\end{array}
\right| \,,
$$
from which we conclude.

The following identity holds
$$

::: Proof


- For point (1) we have
\begin{align*}

v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \\

\right| \\
& = - (\vv \times \uu) \cdot \ww
\end{align*}
where we used that swapping two rows in a matrix changes the sign 
of the determinant. Since $\ww$ is arbitrary, we conclude point (1).

- Let $A \in \R^{3 \times 3}$ be a matrix. Points (2)-(3) follow from the fact that 
$$
\det(A) = 0  
$$
if and only if at least 2 rows or columns of $A$ are linearly dependent.

- Point (4) can be easily verified by direct calculation. 

- Point (5) can be obtained as follows: Check by hand that formula (@eq-formula-cross)
holds for the vectors of the standard basis $\ee_1, \ee_2,\ee_3$;
Then write the vectors $\vv, \ww, \xx,\yy$ in coordinates with  
respect to the standard basis; Using the linearity of the vector product obtained in point (4), conclude that (@eq-formula-cross) holds for $\vv, \ww, \xx,\yy$.

- By definition of $\theta$ we have
$$
\vv \cdot \ww = \| \vv\| \|\ww\| \cos(\theta)
$$
Applying (@eq-formula-cross) with $\xx = \vv$ and $\yy = \ww$ we conclude
\begin{align*}
\| \uu \times \vv \|^2 & = (\uu \times \vv) \cdot (\uu \times \vv) = 
\left|

\uu \cdot \uu & \vv \cdot \uu  \\

& = \| \uu \|^2 \| \vv \|^2 - \| \uu \|^2 \| \vv \|^2 \cos^2(\theta) \\
& = \| \uu \|^2 \| \vv \|^2 (1-\cos^2(\theta)) \\
& = \| \uu \|^2 \| \vv \|^2 \sin^2(\theta) 
\end{align*}

::: Remark
### Geometric interpretation of vector product   {#remark-vector-product}

Let $\uu, \vv \in \R^3$ be linearly independent. We make some observations:

1. Property 3 in Proposition \ref{proposition-vector-product} says that
$$
(\uu \times \vv) \cdot \uu = 0 \,, \quad  (\uu \times \vv) \cdot \vv = 0 \,.
$$
Therefore $\uu \times \vv$ is orthogonal to both $\uu$ and $\vv$. 

2. In particular $\uu \times \vv$ is orthogonal to the plane generated by $\uu$ and $\vv$.

3. Since $\uu$ and $\vv$ are linearly independent, Property 2 in Proposition \ref{proposition-vector-product} says that
$$
\uu \times \vv \neq \zero
$$

4. Therefore we have
$$
(\uu \times \vv) \cdot (\uu \times \vv) = \norm{ \uu \times \vv }^2 > 0 
$$

5. On the other hand, using the definition of $\uu \times \vv$ with $\ww = \vv \times \ww$ yields
$$
(\uu \times \vv) \cdot (\uu \times \vv) =
\left|
\begin{array}{ccc}
u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\
v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \\
(\uu \times \vv)_1 & (\uu \times \vv)_2 & (\uu \times \vv)_3 \\
\end{array}
\right| 
$$

6. Therefore the determinant of the matrix
$$
(\uu | \vv | \uu \times \vv)
$$
is positive. This shows that 
$$
(\uu , \vv , \uu \times \vv)
$$
is a **positive basis** of $\R^3$.

7. Let $\theta$ be the angle between $\vv$ and $\ww$ and 
$A$ the area of the parallelogram with sides $\uu$ and $\vv$, see @fig-cross-geometry.
Basic trigonometry gives that
$$
A = \| u \| \| v \| \sin (\theta) \,.
$$
Using (@eq-formula-cross) we have
$$
\| \uu \times \vv \|  = \| \uu \| \| \vv \| \sin(\theta) = A
$$

![For $\uu,\vv$ linearly independent, $\uu \times \vv$ is orthogonal to the plane generated by $\uu,\vv$. Moreover $\|\uu \times \vv\|$ is the area of the parallelogram with sides $\uu,\vv$, and $(\uu,\vv,\uu \times \vv)$ is a positive basis of $\R^3$](/images/vector_product_orthogonal.png){#fig-cross-geometry width=70%}


We have therefore proven the following theorem.

::: Theorem
### Geometric Properties of vector product {#theorem-vector-product}

Let $\uu,\vv \in \R^3$ be linearly independent. Then

- $\uu \times \vv$ is orthogonal to the plane spanned by $\uu,\vv$
- $\| \uu \times \vv \|$ is equal to the area of the parallelogram with sides $\uu,\vv$
- $\uu \times \vv$ is such that
$$
(\uu,\vv,\uu \times \vv)
$$
is a positive basis of $\R^3$.

:::



We conclude with noting that the cross product is not associative, and with a useful proposition for differentiating the cross product of curves in $\R^3$.



::: Proposition
The vector product is not associative. In particular, for all $\uu, \vv, \ww \in \R^3$ it holds:
$$
(\uu \times \vv) \times \ww = ( \uu \cdot \ww ) \vv - ( \vv \cdot \ww ) \uu \,.
$$ {#eq-cross-prod-triple}

:::

::: Proof

Observe that both sides of (@eq-cross-prod-triple) are linear in $\uu, \vv, \ww$.Therefore it is sufficient to verify (@eq-cross-prod-triple) for the standard basis vectors $\ee_i$. This can be checked by direct calculation.

:::


::: Proposition

Suppose $\g,\eeta \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ are parametrized curves. Then
the curve 
$$
\g \times \eeta \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^3
$$
is smooth, and
$$
\frac{d}{dt} ( \g \times \eeta ) = \dg \times \eeta + \g \times \dot{\eeta} \,.
$${#eq-cross-prod-derivative}

The proof is omitted. It follows immediately from formula (@eq-formula-cross-product).






## Curvature formula in $\R^3$


Given a unit-speed curve
$$
\g \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^n
$$
we defined its curvature as
$$
\kappa(t) := \norm{ \ddg(t) } \,.
$$
When $\g$ is regular we defined the curvature as
$$
\kappa(t) :=  \tkappa(s(t))
$$
where
$$
\tkappa(s) := \norm{ \ddtg(s) }
$$
is the curvature of the arc-length reparametrization $\tg := \g \circ s^{-1}$ of 
$\g$.

If $\g$ is a regular curve in $\R^3$ the following formula can be used to compute $\kappa$ without passing through $\tg$.

::: Proposition
### Curvature formula {#proposition-curvature-formula}

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be a regular curve. The curvature $\kappa(t)$ of $\g$ at $\g(t)$ is given by
$$
\kappa(t) = \frac{ \norm{\dg \times \ddg} }{ \norm{\dg}^3 } \,. 
$${#eq-curvature}

:::


We delay the proof of the above Proposition, as this will get easier when the **Frenet-Serret equations** are introduced. For a proof which does not make use of the Frenet-Serret equations see Proposition 2.1.2 in [@pressley].

For now we use (@eq-curvature) to compute the curvature of specific curves.


::: Example
### Curvature of the straight line

Consider the straight line
$$
\g(t) = \mathbf{a} + t \mathbf{v}
$$
for some $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{v} \in \R^3$ fixed, with $\mathbf{v} \neq \zero$. Then
$$
\dg (t) = \mathbf{v} \,, \quad \ddg(t) = \zero \,. 
$$
Therefore 
$$
\norm{\dg (t)} = \| \mathbf{v} \| \neq 0
$$
showing that $\g$ is regular. We have
$$
\dg \times \ddg = \mathbf{v} \times \zero = \zero \,.
$$
Therefore the curvature is
$$
\kappa(t) = \frac{ \norm{ \dg \times \ddg } }{ \norm{\dg}^3 } = 0 \,,
$$
as expected.
:::



::: Example
### Curvature of Helix {#example-curvature-helix}

Consider the Helix of radius $R>0$ and rise $H>0$
$$
\g (t) = ( R\cos(t) , R\sin(t) , Ht) \,, \quad t \in \R \,.
$$
Then
\begin{align*}
\dg (t) & = ( -R\sin(t) , R\cos(t) , H)  \\
\ddg (t) & = ( -R\cos(t) , -R\sin(t) , 0) 
\end{align*}
From this we deduce that
$$
\norm{\dg (t)}  = \sqrt{R^2 + H^2}\,,
$$
showing that $\g$ is regular. Finally
\begin{align*}
\dg \times \ddg & = 
\left|
\begin{array}{cc}
{\dot\gamma}_2 & {\dot\gamma}_3  \\
{\ddot\gamma}_2 & {\ddot\gamma}_3
\end{array}
\right| \ee_1 -
\left|
\begin{array}{cc}
{\dot\gamma}_1 & {\dot\gamma}_3  \\
{\ddot\gamma}_1 & {\ddot\gamma}_3
\end{array}
\right| \ee_2 +
\left|
\begin{array}{cc}
{\dot\gamma}_1 & {\dot\gamma}_2  \\
{\ddot\gamma}_1 & {\ddot\gamma}_2
\end{array}
\right| \ee_3 \\
& = 
\left|
\begin{array}{cc}
R\cos(t) & H \\
-R\sin(t) & 0
\end{array}
\right| \ee_1 -
\left|
\begin{array}{cc}
-R\sin(t) & H \\
-R\cos(t) & 0 
\end{array}
\right| \ee_2 +
\left|
\begin{array}{cc}
-R\sin(t) & R\cos(t) \\
-R\cos(t) & -R\sin(t)  
\end{array}
\right| \ee_3 \\
& = 
\left(   
RH\sin(t),    
-RH\cos(t),
 R^2\cos^2(t) + R^2\sin^2(t)
\right) \\
& = 
\left(   
RH\sin(t),    
-RH\cos(t),
R^2
\right) 
\end{align*}
and therefore
$$
\norm{ \dg \times \ddg } =  R\sqrt{R^2 + H^2   } \,.
$$
By the general formula we have
$$
\kappa = \frac{ \norm{ \dg \times \ddg } }{ \norm{\dg}^3 } =
\frac{ R (R^2 + H^2)^{\frac12} }{  (R^2 + H^2)^{\frac32}    } =
\frac{ R }{  R^2 + H^2   } 
$$

We notice the following:

1. If $H=0$ then the Helix is just a circle of radius $R$. In this case the curvature is
$$
\kappa  = \frac{1}{R}
$$
which agrees with the curvature computed for the circle of radius $R$.

2. If $R=0$ then the Helix is just parametrizing the $z$-axis. In this case the curvature is
$$
\kappa  = 0 \,,
$$
which agrees with the curvature of a straight line.

## Signed curvature of plane curves

In this section we assume to have plane curves, that is, curves with values in $\R^2$. In this case we can give a geometric interpretation for the sign of the curvature. This cannot be done in higher dimension.


::: Definition

Let $\g \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^2$ be unit-speed. We define the **signed unit normal** to $\g$ at $\g(t)$ as the unit vector $\nn(t)$ obtained by rotating $\dg(t)$ anti-clockwise by an angle of $\pi/2$.

:::


::: Definition

Let $\g \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^2$ be unit-speed. The **signed curvature** of $\g$ at $\g(t)$ is the scalar $\kappa_s(t)$ such that
$$
\ddg(t) = k_s(t) \nn(t)
$$
:::

::: Remark
Notice that since $\nn$ is a unit vector and $\g$ is unit-speed, then
$$
|\kappa_s(t)| = \norm{\ddg(t)} = \kappa(t) \,.
$$
We deduce that the signed curvature is related to the curvature by
$$
\kappa_s(t) = \pm \kappa(t) \,.
$$
:::


::: Remark
It can be shown that the signed curvature is the rate at which the tangent vector $\dg$ of the curve $\g$ rotates. The signed curvature is:

- positive if $\dg$ is rotating anti-clockwise
- negative if $\dg$ is rotating clockwise

In other words, 

- $k_s > 0$ means the curve is turning left,
- $k_s < 0$ means the curve is turning right.

A rigorous justification of the above statement is found in Proposition 2.2.3 in [@pressley].
:::



For curves which are not unit-speed, we define the signed curvature as the signed curvature of the unit-speed reparametrization. 



::: Definition

Let $\g \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^2$ be regular and let $\tg$ be a unit-speed reparametrization of $\g$. The **signed curvature** of $\g$ at $\g(t)$ is the scalar $\kappa_s(t)$ such that
$$
\ddtg(t) = k_s(t) \nn(t) \,,
$$
where $\nn(t)$ is the unit vector obtained by rotating $\dtg(t)$ anti-clockwise by an angle $\pi/2$.
:::


The signed curvature completely determines plane curves, in the sense of the following theorem.


::: Theorem
### Characterization of plane curves {#theorem-characterization-plane}

Let $\f \ \colon \R \to \R$ be smooth. Then:

1. There exists a unit-speed curve $\g \ \colon \R \to \R^2$ such that its signed curvature $\kappa_s$ satisfies
$$
\kappa_s(t) = \f(t) \,, \quad \forall \, t \in \R \,.
$$

2. Suppose that $\tg \ \colon \R \to \R^2$ is a unit-speed curve such that its signed curvature $\tkappa_s$ satisfies
$$
\tkappa_s(t) = \f(t) \,, \quad \forall \, t \in \R \,.
$$
Then 
$$
\tg = \g
$$
up to rotations and translations.
:::


We do not prove the above theorem. For a proof, see Theorem 2.2.6 in [@pressley].






## Space curves

We will now deal with **space curves**, that is, curves with values in $\R^3$. There are several issues compared to the plane case:

- A 3D counterpart of the signed curvature is not available, since there is no notion of *turning left* or *turning right*.

- We have seen in the previous section that the signed curvature completely characterizes plane curves. In 3D however curvature is not enough to characterize curves: there exist $\g$ and $\eeta$ space curves such that 
$$
\kappa^{\g} = \kappa^{\eeta} \quad \text{ but } \quad  \g \neq \eeta \,,
$$
that is, $\g$ and $\eeta$ have same curvature but are different curves.



::: Example
### Different curves with same curvature

Let $\g$ be a circle of radius $R>0$
$$
\g(t) = (R\cos(t),R\sin(t),0) \,,
$$
and $\eeta$ be a helix of radius $S>0$ and rise $H>0$
$$
\eeta(t) = (S\cos(t),S\sin(t),Ht) \,.
$$
We have computed that 
$$
\kappa^\g = \frac{1}{R}\,, \quad 
\kappa^\eeta = \frac{S}{S^2 + H^2} \,.
$$
If we now choose $R=2$ and we impose that $\kappa^\g = \kappa^\eeta$ we get
$$
\frac12 = \frac{S}{S^2 + H^2} \quad \implies \quad  H^2 = 2S - S^2 
$$
Choosing $S=1$ and $H=1$ yields 
$$
\kappa^\g = \kappa^\eeta \,, \quad   \g \neq \eeta \,.
$$
:::


Therefore curvature is not enough for characterizing space curves, and we need a new quantity. 
As we did with curvature, we start by considering the simpler case of unit-speed curves. We will also
need to assume that the curvature is never zero.

We start by introducing the *principal normal*, which is
just the unit vector obtained by renormalizing $\ddg$.


::: Definition
### Principal normal vector

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be a unit-speed curve with 
$$
\kappa(t) \neq 0 \,, \quad \forall \,t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
The **principal normal vector** to $\g$ at $\g(t)$ is 
$$
\nn(t) := \frac{1}{\kappa (t)} \, \ddg(t) \,.
$$
:::



::: Remark

The principal normal is a unit vector orthogonal to $\dg$, that is,
$$
\norm{ \nn (t) } = 1 \,, \qquad \dg \cdot \nn = 0 \,.
$$

>*Proof.* For $\g$ unit-speed we defined the curvature as
$$
\kappa (t) := \norm{ \ddg(t) } \,.
$$
Therefore 
$$
\| \nn \| = \frac{1}{\norm{ \ddg(t) }} \, \norm{ \ddg(t) } = 1
$$
In addition for $\g$ unit-speed it holds that $\dg \cdot \ddg = 0$. Therefore
$$
\dg \cdot \nn = \frac{1}{\kappa} \, \dg \cdot \ddg = 0 \,.
$$

Why is the principal normal interesting? Because it can tell the difference beween a plane curve and a space curve, see @fig-principal-normal.

We now introduce the binormal vector $\bb$ as the vector product of $\dg$ and $\nn$. By the properties of vector
product we will see that the triple 
$$
(\dg, \nn, \bb)
$$
forms a positive orthonormal basis of $\R^3$.

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be a unit-speed curve with 
$$
\kappa(t) \neq 0 \,, \quad \forall \,t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
The **binormal vector** to $\g$ at $\g(t)$ is 
$$
\bb(t) := \dg (t) \times \nn(t) \,.
$$
:::



::: Definition
### Orthonormal basis

Let $\vv_1, \vv_2, \vv_3$ be vectors in $\R^3$. We say that the triple
$$
\{\vv_1, \vv_2,\vv_3\}
$$
is **orthonormal** if 
$$
\norm{v_i} = 1 \,, \quad   v_i \cdot v_j = 0 \,, \,\, \mbox{ for } \, i \neq j \,.
$$
:::



::: Proposition
Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be a unit-speed curve with
$$
\kappa(t) \neq 0 \,, \quad \forall \,t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
Then the triple
$$
B = (  \dg(t), \nn(t), \bb(t)  )
$$
is a positive orthonormal basis of $\R^3$ for all $t \in (a,b)$.
:::



::: Proof

Since $\g$ is unit-speed we have
$$
\norm{ \dg (t) } \equiv 1 \,.
$$
Moreover we have already observed that 
$$
\norm{\nn(t)} \equiv 1 \,, \quad \dg (t) \cdot \nn(t) \equiv 0 \,.
$$
As $\bb$ is defined by
$$
\bb:= \dg \times \nn \,,
$$
by the properties of the vector product, see Proposition \ref{proposition-vector-product}, it follows that
$$
\bb \cdot \dg = 0 \,, \quad  \bb \cdot \nn = 0  \,.
$$
By the calculation in Remark \ref{remark-vector-product} Point 8, we have that
$$
\norm{ \bb }^2 = \| \dg \|^2 \|\nn \|^2 -   |\dg \cdot \nn|^2 = 1   \,.
$$
This shows that the vectors $\{ \dg, \nn, \bb \}$
are orthonormal. By the properties of the vector product, see Remark \ref{remark-vector-product} Point 6, we also know that
$$
( \dg, \nn, \bb  )
$$
is a positive basis of $\R^3$.
:::


Therefore to each unit-speed curve $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ with non-vanishing curvature we can associate a positive orthonormal basis of $\R^3$. Such basis is known as Frenet frame.


::: Definition
### Frenet frame

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be unit-speed with $\kappa \neq 0$. The positive orthonormal basis of $\R^3$
$$
( \dg, \nn, \bb )
$$
is called **Frenet frame** of $\g$.

:::


::: Notation
For $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ unit-speed the **tangent vector** is often denoted by
$$
\ttt := \dg
$$
Therefore the Frenet frame of $\g$ can be equivalently written as
$$
( \ttt, \nn, \bb ) \,.
$$

:::



By using unit-speed reparametrizations we 
can also compute the Frenet frame for regular curves with non-vanishing curvature. In doing so, we need to be aware 
of the following:


::: Warning 

The Frenet frame depends on the **orientation** of the curve, see next Definition and Proposition.

:::


::: Definition

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be regular and
$\tg$ be a reparametrization with
$$
\g = \tg \circ \phi \,,  \quad \f \colon  (a,b) \to (\tilde{a},\tilde{b})  \,.
$$
We say that

1. $\tg$ is *orientation preserving* if $\dot \f > 0$
2. $\tg$ is *orientation reversing* if $\dot \f < 0$

:::



::: Proposition
### Frenet frame of reparametrization {#proposition-frenet-reparametrization}

$\tg$ be a unit-speed reparametrization with
$$
\g = \tg \circ \phi \,,  \quad \f \colon  (a,b) \to (\tilde{a},\tilde{b})  \,.
$$
Then $\dot{\f}$ is constant, with either 
$$
\dot{\f}  \equiv 1 \quad \text{or} \quad 
\dot{\f}  \equiv - 1
$$
Denote by 
$$
(\ttt, \nn, \bb)\,, \qquad 
(\tttt, \tnn, \tbb)
$$
the Frenet frames of $\g$ and $\tg$, respectively. We have:

1. If $\tg$ is *orientation preserving* then $\dot \f \equiv 1$ and
$$
\ttt = \tttt \circ \f , \quad \nn = \tnn \circ \f, \quad 
\bb = \tbb \circ \f

2. If $\tg$ is *orientation reversing* then $\dot \f \equiv -1$ and
$$

\bb = -\tbb \circ \f
$$

:::



::: Proof

Differentiating $\g = \tg \circ \phi$ gives
$$
\dg(t) = \dtg ( \f(t) ) \ \dot{\f}(t)
$${#eq-chain-unit-speed}
Taking the norms in (@eq-chain-unit-speed) and recalling 
that $\g$ and $\tg$ are unit speed yields
$|\dot{\f} | = 1$. 
By continuity of $\dot \f$ either
$$
\dot{\f}  \equiv 1 \quad \text{or} \quad

$$
\ttt(t) = \tttt( \f(t) ) \ \dot{\f}(t)
$${#eq-chain-unit-speed-4}
By Proposition \ref{proposition-curvature-invariant} the 
curvatures $\kappa, \tkappa$ of $\g, \tg$ are related by
$$

$${#eq-chain-unit-speed-5}
Dividing both sides of (@eq-chain-unit-speed-3) by $\kappa(t)$ 
and using (@eq-chain-unit-speed-5) gives
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{\kappa(t)} \ \ddg (t) & =
\frac{1}{\kappa(t)} \ \ddtg (\f(t)) \\
& = \frac{1}{\tkappa(\f(t))} \ \ddtg(\f(t))

$${#eq-chain-unit-speed-6}
By definition the principal normals are

To summarize, we have shown the following relations between the Frenet frames of $\g$ and $\tg$
$$

\nn(t) & = \tnn ( \f(t) ) \\
\bb(t) & = \tbb( \f(t) ) \ \dot{\f} (t) 
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-chain-unit-speed-8}
We can finally conclude:

1. If $\tg$ is orientation preserving then $\dot \f > 0$. By (@eq-chain-unit-speed-2) we infer $\dot \f \equiv 1$, so that the equations at (@eq-chain-unit-speed-8) read
$$
\ttt = \tttt \circ \f , \quad \nn = \tnn \circ \f, \quad 
\bb = \tbb \circ \f
$$

2. If $\tg$ is orientation reversing then $\dot \f < 0$. By (@eq-chain-unit-speed-2) we infer $\dot \f \equiv - 1$, so that the equations at (@eq-chain-unit-speed-8) read
$$
\ttt = - \tttt \circ \f , \quad \nn = \tnn \circ \f, \quad 
\bb = - \tbb \circ \f
$$

:::


In conclusion, the Frenet frame is not invariant under 
reparametrization. However the Frenet vectors stay the same,
up to changing the sign of tangent and binormal.

$$
\ttt = \pm \tttt \circ \f , \quad \nn = \tnn \circ \f, \quad 
\bb = \pm \tbb \circ \f
$$




Let us conclude the section with an example, where we compute
the Frenet frame of the Helix.


::: Example
### Frenet frame of Helix {#example-helix-frenet}

Consider the helix of radius $R>0$ and rise $H$ given by
$$
\g (t) = ( R\cos(t), R\sin(t),t H)\,,
$$
for $t \in \R$. We have that
$$
\dg (t) = ( -R\sin(t), R\cos(t), H )
$$
which implies
$$
\norm{ \dg } = \rho, \qquad \rho := \sqrt{R^2 + H^2} \,.
$$
This shows that $\g$ is regular, since
$$
\norm{ \dg } = \rho = \sqrt{R^2 + H^2} \geq \sqrt{R^2} = R > 0
$$
However $\g$ is not unit-speed in general. 
We know that all unit-speed reparametrizations are of the form
$$
\f = \pm s + c \,,
$$
where $s$ is the arc-length and $c \in \R$. Therefore we compute the arc-length of $\g$ starting at $t_0 = 0$
$$
s(t) := \int_0^t \norm{ \dg(u) } \, du = \rho  t \,.  
$$
The arc-length function is invertible with inverse 
$$
\psi(s) := t(s) = \frac{s}{\rho} \,.
$$
Therefore a unit-speed reparametrization of $\g$ is given by
$$
\tg(s):= \g( t(s)) = \left( R \cos \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) ,R \sin \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) , \frac{H s }{\rho}    \right) \,.
$$
We compute the tangent vector to $\tg$ and its derivative
\begin{align*}
\tttt & = \dtg  = \frac{1}{\rho}
 \left(  - R \sin \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) , 
 R \cos \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) 
 , H    \right) \\
\dot{\tttt} & = \frac{R}{\rho^2} \left(  -\cos \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) , -\sin \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) , 0    \right)
\end{align*}
We have already computed the curvature of the Helix in 
Example \ref{example-curvature-helix} by using the general 
formula. We now compute it again, but this time by using the
unit-speed reparametrization just obtained:
$$
\tkappa (s) = \norm{ \dot{\tttt} } = \frac{R}{\rho^2} = \frac{R}{R^2 + H^2}\,.
$$
The principal normal vector is then
$$
\tnn = \frac{1}{\tkappa(t)} \, \dot{\tttt} = \left(  -\cos \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) , -\sin \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) , 0    \right) \,.
$$
We can now compute the binormal
\begin{align*}
\tbb& = \tttt \times \tnn  \\
    & = \frac{1}{\rho}
    \left|
    \begin{array}{ccc}
    \ii & \jj & \kk \\
    - R \sin \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right)  & R \cos \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) & H \\
    - \cos \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) & - \sin \left( \frac{s}{ \rho }  \right) & 0 
    \end{array}
    \right| \\
    & =  \frac{1}{\rho} \left( H \sin \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) , - H \cos \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) ,  R \right) \,.
\end{align*}
This concludes the calculation of the Frenet frame of $\tg$. 
For the choice of $R = 1$ and $H = 1$ the Frenet frame is plotted in @fig-helix-frenet.

**Note:** If we had reparametrized $\g$ by $-s$ instead of $s$, we would have obtained the Frenet frame
$$
(- \tttt , \tnn, - \tbb)
$$
in accordance with Proposition \ref{proposition-frenet-reparametrization}.

## Torsion

For space curves with non-vanishing curvature we can define
another scalar quantity, known as *torsion*. Such quantity
allows to measure by how much a curve fails to be planar. 

The torsion can be defined by computing the derivative of the binormal vector $\bb$. 


::: {.Proposition #proposition-binormal}

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be a unit-speed curve with $\kappa \neq 0$. Then
$$
\dot{\bb} (t) = - \tau(t) \nn(t) \,,
$$ {#eq-binormal-derivative}
for some $\tau(t) \in \R$. 

:::


::: Proof

By definition $\bb = \ttt \times \nn$. Using the formula of derivation of the cross product (@eq-cross-prod-derivative) we have
\begin{align*}
\dot{\bb} & = \frac{d}{dt} ( \ttt \times \nn  ) \\
          & = \dot{\ttt} \times \nn + \ttt \times \dot{\nn} \\
          & =  \ttt \times \dot{\nn} \,,
\end{align*}
where we used that, by definition of $\nn$,
$$
\dot{\ttt} \times \nn  = \frac{1}{\kappa} \dot{\ttt} \times \dot{\ttt} = \zero \,.
$$
This shows
$$
\dot{\bb} = \dg \times \dot{\nn} \,.
$${#eq-derivative-b-1}
By the properties of the cross product we have 
that $\ttt \times \dot{\nn}$ is orthogonal to both $\ttt$
and $\dot{\nn}$. Thus (@eq-derivative-b-1) implies that
$$
\dot{\bb} \cdot \ttt = 0 \,.
$$
Further, observe that
$$
\frac{d}{dt}( \bb \cdot \bb ) = \dot{\bb} \cdot \bb + \bb \cdot \dot{\bb} = 2\dot{\bb} \cdot \bb \,.
$$
On the other hand, since $\bb$ is a unit vector, we have 
$$
\frac{d}{dt}( \bb \cdot \bb ) = \frac{d}{dt}( \norm{\bb}^2 ) = \frac{d}{dt}( 1 ) = 0 \,  
$$
Therefore 
$$
\dot{\bb} \cdot \bb = 0 \,.
$$
showing that $\dot{\bb}$ is orthogonal to $\bb$. We also shown that $\dot{\bb}$ is orthogonal to $\ttt$. Since the Frenet frame
$$
( \ttt, \nn , \bb )
$$
is an orthonormal basis of $\R^3$, and $\dot{\bb}$ is orthogonal to both $\ttt$ and $\bb$, we conclude that $\dot{\bb}$ is parallel to $\nn$. Therefore there exists $\tau(t) \in \R$ such that 
$$
\dot{\bb} = - \tau(t) \nn(t) \,,
$$
concluding the proof.
:::

The scalar $\tau$ in equation (@eq-binormal-derivative) is called the torsion of $\g$.

::: Definition
### Torsion of unit-speed curve with $\kappa \neq 0$

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be a unit-speed curve, with $\kappa \neq 0$. The **torsion** of $\g$ at $\g(t)$ is the unique scalar
$$
\tau (t) \in \R
$$
such that
$$
\dot{\bb} (t) = - \tau(t) \nn(t) \,.
$$

:::



::: Remark
### Formula for torsion {#remark-torsion-formula}

In particular the torsion satisfies:
$$
\tau(t) = - \dot{\bb} (t) \cdot \nn (t) \,.
$$

> *Proof.* Multiply (@eq-binormal-derivative) by $\nn$ and note that $\| \nn \| = 1$.

:::



::: Warning

We defined the torsion **only** for space curves  $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$
which are unit-speed and have non-vanishing curvature, that is, such that
$$
\norm{\dg(t)} = 1 \,, \quad \kappa(t) = \norm{ \ddg(t) }  \neq 0 \,, \qquad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$

:::


As we did for curvature, we can extend the definition of torsion to regular curves $\g$ with non-vanishing curvature.


::: Definition
### Torsion of regular curve with $\kappa \neq 0$ {#definition-torsion-regular}


Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be a regular curve, with $\kappa \neq 0$. Let $\tg$ be a unit-speed reparametrization of 
$\g$, with 
$$
\g = \tg \circ \phi \,,  \quad \f \colon  (a,b) \to (\tilde{a},\tilde{b})  \,.
$$
Denote by $\ttau \colon (\tilde{a},\tilde{b}) \to \R$ the torsion of $\tg$. The **torsion** of $\g$ at $\g(t)$ is defined by
$$
\tau(t) := \ttau(\f(t))
$$

:::


As usual, we need to check that the above definition of torsion does not depend 
on the choice of unit-speed reparametrization $\tg$.


::: Proposition 
### $\tau$ is invariant for unit-speed reparametrization

Consider the setting of Definition \ref{definition-torsion-regular}. Let $\hat{\g}$ is another
unit-speed reparametrization of $\g$, with $\g = \hat{\g} \circ \psi$. Then
$$
\tau(t) = \ttau( \f (t) ) = \hat{\tau}( \psi (t) ) 
$$
where $\hat{\tau}$ is the torsion of $\hat{\g}$.

:::


::: Proof

The curves $\tg$ and $\hat{\g}$ are unit-speed, therefore
they are defined their Frenet frames
$$
(\tttt, \tnn, \tbb) \,, \qquad
(\hat{\ttt}, \hat{\nn}, \hat{\bb})
$$
Since $\tg$ and $\hat{\g}$ are both reparametrization of $\g$
$$
\tg(\f(t)) = \g(t) = \hat{\g}(\psi(t))
$$
Using that $\f$ is invertible we obtain
$$
\tg(t) = \hat{\g} (\xi(t)) \,, \qquad \xi := \psi \circ \f^{-1} 
$$
with $\xi$ diffeomorphims.
The above formula is saying that $\hat{\g}$ is a reparametrization of $\tg$. As both $\tg$ and $\hat{\g}$ are unit-speed, we can apply Proposition \ref{proposition-frenet-reparametrization} and infer that the Frenet frames are linked by the formulas
$$
\tttt = \pm \, \hat{\ttt} \circ \xi \,, \qquad 
\tnn = \hat{\nn} \circ \xi \,, \qquad 
\tbb = \pm \, \hat{\bb} \circ \xi
$${#eq-torsion-invariant-1}
and $\xi$ satisfies
$$
\dot \xi \equiv \pm 1 \,.
$$
Differentiating the third equation in (@eq-torsion-invariant-1) gives
$$
\dot{\tbb}(t) = \pm \, \frac{d}{dt} \hat{\bb}(\xi(t)) = 
\pm \, \dot {\hat{\bb}} (\xi(t)) \dot \xi (t) = \dot {\hat{\bb}} (\xi(t))
$${#eq-torsion-invariant-2}
where we used that $\dot\xi \equiv \pm 1$.
By Remark \ref{remark-torsion-formula} the torsions of $\tg$ and $\dtg$ are computed by
$$
\ttau = - \dot{ \tbb } \cdot \tnn \,, \qquad  
\hat{\tau} = - \dot{ \hat{\bb} } \cdot \hat{\nn}
$$
Using the second equation in (@eq-torsion-invariant-1) and (@eq-torsion-invariant-2) allows to infer
$$
\ttau (t) = - \dot{ \tbb }(t) \cdot \tnn(t) = - \dot{ \hat{\bb} }(\xi(t)) \cdot \hat{\nn}(\xi(t)) = 
\hat{\tau}(\xi(t))
$$
Recalling that $\xi = \psi \circ \f^{-1}$ we conclude
$$
\ttau (\f(t)) = \hat{\tau}(\psi(t))
$$
as required. 

:::






As with the curvature, there is a general 
formula to compute the torsion without having to reparametrize.


::: Proposition 
### Torsion formula   {#proposition-torsion-formula}

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be a regular curve with non-vanishing curvature. The torsion $\tau(t)$ of $\g$ at $\g(t)$ is given by
$$
\tau (t) = \frac{ ( \dg \times \ddg ) \cdot \dddg }{ \norm{ \dg \times \ddg }^2 } \,. 
$${#eq-torsion-formula}

:::

We delay the proof of the above Proposition, as this will get easier when the **Frenet-Serret equations** are introduced. For a proof which does not make use of the Frenet-Serret equations, see the proof of Proposition 2.3.1 in [@pressley].

For now we use (@eq-torsion-formula) to compute the curvature of specific curves.




::: Example
### Torsion Helix {#example-torsion-helix}


Consider the Helix of radius $R>0$ and rise $H>0$
$$
\g (t) = ( R\cos(t) , R\sin(t) , Ht) \,, \quad t \in \R \,.
$$
We have already shown that
$$
\norm{\dg (t)}  = \sqrt{R^2 + H^2}\,,  \quad  \kappa = \frac{R}{R^2 + H^2} \,.
$$
Therefore the Helix is regular with non-vanishing curvature. The torsion can be then
computed via the formula 
$$
\tau (t) = \frac{ ( \dg \times \ddg ) \cdot \dddg }{ \norm{ \dg \times \ddg }^2 } \,. 
$$
Let us compute the quantities appearing in the formula for $\tau$
\begin{align*}
\dg (t) & = ( -R\sin(t) , R\cos(t) , H)  \\
\ddg (t) & = ( -R\cos(t) , -R\sin(t) , 0) \\
\dddg (t) & = ( R\sin(t) , -R\cos(t) , 0) 
\end{align*}
Moreover we had already computed that
\begin{align*}
\dg \times \ddg & = \left( RH\sin(t), -RH\cos(t), R^2 \right)  \\
\norm{ \dg \times \ddg } & =  R\sqrt{R^2 + H^2   } \,.
\end{align*}
Finally we compute
$$
(\dg \times \ddg) \cdot \dddg = R^2 H \,.
$$
We are ready to find the torsion:
$$
\tau = \frac{ ( \dg \times \ddg ) \cdot \dddg }{ \norm{ \dg \times \ddg }^2 }
       = \frac{ H }{ R^2 + H^2 } \,.
$$
:::


As a consequence of the above example, we can immediately
infer curvature and torsion formulas for the circle.



::: Example 
### Curvature and Torsion of Circle   {#example-circle-curvature-torsion}

The Circle of radius $R>0$ is
$$
\g(t) := ( R \cos(t), R \sin(t) , 0 ) \,.
$$
The curvature and torsion of the Helix of radius $R$ and rise $H>0$ are
$$
\kappa = \frac{R}{R^2 + H^2}\,, \quad \tau = \frac{H}{R^2 + H^2}  \,.
$$
For $H=0$ the Helix coincides with the Circle $\g$. Therefore we can set $H=0$ in the 
above formulas to obtain the 
curvature and torsion of the Circle
$$
\kappa = \frac{1}{R}\,, \quad \tau = 0  \,.
$$

:::


From the above example we notice that the torsion of the circle is $0$. This is true in general for space curves which are contained in a plane: we will prove this result in general. For the moment, let us give an example for which this happens, that is, an example of space curve $\g$ which is contained in a plane. 


::: {.Example  #example-circle-rotated}
Define the space curve
$$
\g(t) := \left( \frac45 \cos(t),  1 - \sin(t) , -\frac35 \cos(t)  \right) \,,
$$
for $t \in \R$. As seen in the plot in @fig-circle-rigid, $\g$ is just a Circle which has been rotated an translated. Therefore $\g$ is contained in a plane, and we expect curvature and torsion to be
$$
\kappa = \frac1R , \quad \tau = 0\,, 
$$
for some $R>0$, radius of the Circle $\g$. Let us proceed with the calculations:
$$
\dg =   \left( -\frac45 \sin(t),  - \cos(t) , \frac35 \sin(t)  \right)
$$
so that 
$$
\norm{ \dg }^2 = \frac{16}{25} \sin^2(t) + \cos^2(t) + \frac{9}{25} \sin^2(t) = 1\,,
$$
showing that $\g$ is regular and unit-speed. 
Therefore we can compute curvature and torsion by using the Frenet frame. We have
$$
\ddg  =  \left( -\frac45 \cos(t),  \sin(t) , \frac35 \cos(t)  \right) \,.
$$
As $\g$ is unit-speed, the curvature and principal normal are
\begin{align*}
\kappa & = \norm{ \ddot \g } = \frac{16}{25} \cos^2(t) + \sin^2(t) + \frac{9}{25} \cos^2(t) = 1 \\
\nn & = \frac{1}{\kappa}  \ddg =  \left( -\frac45 \cos(t),  \sin(t) , \frac35 \cos(t)  \right) \,.
\end{align*}
We can then compute the binormal
\begin{align*}
\bb & = \dg \times \nn \\ 
    & = 
    \left|
\begin{array}{ccc}
\ii & \jj & \kk \\
-\frac{4}{5} \sin (t)  & - \cos(t) & \frac35 \sin(t) \\
 -\frac45 \cos(t) &  \sin(t) & \frac35 \cos(t) 
\end{array} \right| \\
    & = \left(  -\frac35 \cos^2(t) - \frac35 \sin^2(t), - \frac{12}{25} \cos(t) \sin(t) + \frac{12}{25} \cos(t) \sin(t), - \frac45 \sin^2(t) - \frac45 \cos^2(t)   \right) \\
    & = \left( -\frac35, 0 ,-\frac45  \right) \,.
\end{align*}
In particular
$$
\dot{\bb} = 0\,,
$$
and we obtain that the torsion is
$$
\tau = - \dot{\bb} \cdot \nn = 0 \,.

Let us summarize our findings about curvature and torsion.


::: Important
### Summary

Recall that:

1. Curvature $\kappa$ is defined only for regular curves.
2. Torsion $\tau$ is defined only for regular curves with non-vanishing $\kappa$.
3. Both $\kappa$ and $\tau$ are invariant under unit-speed reparametrizations

The two strategies for computing $\kappa$ and $\tau$ are summarized in the diagram in @fig-diagram.

:::

![How to compute $\kappa$ and $\tau$ for regular curve $\g$.](/images/diagram_curvature_torsion.png){#fig-diagram width=80%}




We have already made an example in which we compute
curvature and torsion of the Helix using the general formulas
$$
\kappa = \frac{\norm{ \dg \times \ddg }}{ \norm{ \dg }^2 } \,, \qquad
\tau = \frac{ (\dg \times \ddg ) \cdot \dddg }{ \norm{ \dg \times \ddg }^2 } \,.
$$
We conclude the section by providing an example where we compute curvature and torsion by making use of the Frenet frame.



::: Example
### Curvature and torsion of Helix with Frenet frame

Consider the helix of radius $R>0$ and rise $H$ given by
$$
\g (t) = ( R\cos(t), R\sin(t),t H )\,,
$$
for $t \in \R$. We want to compute curvature and torsion by following the diagram at @fig-diagram.
We ask the first question:
$$
\mbox{Is $\g$ unit-speed?}
$$
We have already computed in Example \ref{example-helix-frenet} that
$$
\norm{ \dg } = \rho \,, \qquad \rho := \sqrt{R^2 + H^2} \,.
$$
This shows that $\g$ is regular but not unit-speed. We ask the second question in the diagram:
$$
\mbox{Can we find the arc-length reparametrization of $\g$?}
$$
We have already computed the arc-length reparametrization
of $\g$ in Example \ref{example-helix-frenet}. This is given
by 
$$
\tg(s) = \left( R \cos \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) ,R \sin \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) , \frac{H s }{\rho}    \right) \,.
$$
The next step in the diagram is
$$
\mbox{Compute Frenet frame $\{ \ttt, \nn, \bb \}$ and curvature $\kappa$, torsion $\tau$}
$$
From Example \ref{example-helix-frenet}, the Frenet frame and curvature of $\tg$ are
\begin{align*}
\tttt & =  \frac{1}{\rho}
 \left(  - R \sin \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) , 
 R \cos \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) 
 , H    \right)\\
\tnn & = \left(  -\cos \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) , -\sin \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) , 0    \right) \\
\tbb & = \frac{1}{\rho} \left(  H\sin \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) , - H \cos \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) ,  R \right) \\
\tkappa & = \norm{ \dot{\tttt} } = \frac{R}{\rho^2} = \frac{R}{R^2 + H^2}
\end{align*}
we are left to compute the torsion using formula
$$
\ttau = - \dot{\tbb} \cdot \tnn 
$$
Indeed, we have
$$
\dot{\tbb} = \frac{H}{\rho^2} \left(  \cos \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) , \sin \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) , 0   \right)
$$
and therefore 
$$
\dot{\tbb} \cdot \nn = \frac{H}{\rho^2} \left( - \cos^2 \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) -  \sin^2 \left( \frac{s}{\rho}  \right) \right) = - \frac{H}{\rho^2} \,.
$$
The torsion is then
$$
\ttau = - \dot{\tbb} \cdot \tnn = \frac{H}{\rho^2} = \frac{H}{R^2 + H^2} \,,
$$
which of course agrees with the calculation for $\tau$ in Example \ref{example-torsion-helix}.

## Frenet-Serret equations

For unit-speed curves $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ with non-vanishing curvature we introduced the Frenet frame
$$
\{ \ttt, \nn, \bb \} \,.
$$
We proved that the Frenet frame is a positive orthonormal basis of $\R^3$. We also used such basis to compute curvature $\kappa$ and torsion $\tau$ of $\g$:
$$
\kappa := \| \dot{\ttt} \| \,, \quad \tau := - \dot{\bb} \cdot \nn \,. 
$$

In this section we show that the Frenet frame satisfies a linear system of ODEs
known as the Frenet-Serret equations. In order to do this, we first need 
prove that the Frenet frame 
$$
( \ttt, \nn, \bb  )
$$ 
is *right-handed*. Such property holds in 
general for any positive basis of $\R^3$ of the form
$$
(\uu, \vv , \ww ) \,, \qquad \ww := \uu \times \vv \,.
$$



::: Proposition
### Frenet frame is right-handed {#proposition-positive-basis}

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be a unit-speed curve with $\kappa \neq 0$. The Frenet frame is *right-handed*, in the sense that
$$
\bb = \ttt \times \nn \,, \quad
\nn = \bb \times \ttt \,, \quad
\ttt = \nn \times \bb \,.
$$ {#eq-frenet-positive-basis}

:::


::: Proof

The first equation in (@eq-frenet-positive-basis) is true by definition of $\bb$. For the remaining $2$ equations, recall formula (@eq-cross-prod-triple): 
$$
(\uu \times \vv ) \times \ww = ( \uu \cdot \ww) \vv - ( \vv \cdot \ww ) \uu \,,
$${#eq-cross-prod-triple-1}
which holds for all $\uu,\vv,\ww \in \R^3$. Applying (@eq-cross-prod-triple-1) to
$$
\uu = \ttt \,, \quad \vv = \nn \,, \quad \ww = \ttt \,,
$$
yields
\begin{align*}
( \ttt \times \nn ) \times \ttt & = ( \ttt \cdot \ttt ) \nn - (\nn \cdot \ttt) \ttt \\
                                      & = \norm{\ttt }^2 \nn - \zero \\
                                      & = \nn \,,
\end{align*}
where we used that $\ttt$ is a unit vector and $\nn \cdot \ttt = 0$. Therefore, by definition of $\bb$, we have
$$
\bb \times \ttt = ( \ttt \times \nn ) \times \ttt = \nn
$$
obtaining the second equation in (@eq-frenet-positive-basis). Now we apply (@eq-cross-prod-triple-1) to 
$$
\uu = \ttt \,, \quad \vv = \nn \,, \quad \ww = \nn \,,
$$
to get
\begin{align*}
( \ttt \times \nn ) \times \nn  & = ( \ttt \cdot \nn ) \nn - (\nn \cdot \nn ) \ttt \\
                                      & = \zero - \| \nn \|^2 \ttt  \\
                                      & = - \ttt
\end{align*}
where we used that $\nn$ is a unit vector and $\ttt \cdot \nn= 0$. Therefore, by definition of $\bb$ and anti-commutativity of the vector product, we have
$$
\nn \times \bb = - \bb \times \nn = - (\ttt \times \nn ) \times \nn = \ttt \,,
$$
obtaining the last equation in (@eq-frenet-positive-basis).

::: Theorem
### Frenet-Serret equations

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be unit-speed with $\kappa \neq 0$. The **Frenet-Serret** equations are
\begin{align*}  
\dot{\ttt} & = \kappa \nn \\
\dot{\nn} & = - \kappa \ttt + \tau \bb \\
\dot{\bb} & = -\tau \nn
\end{align*}
:::

::: Proof 

The first Frenet-Serret equation
$$
\dot{\ttt}  = \kappa \nn
$${#eq-proof-frenet-2}
is just the definition of $\nn$. The third Frenet-Serret equation
$$
\dot{\bb} = - \tau \nn
$${#eq-proof-frenet-3}
holds by Proposition \ref{proposition-binormal}. Now, recall that in Proposition \ref{proposition-positive-basis} we have proven
$$
\bb = \ttt \times \nn \,, \quad
\nn = \bb \times \ttt \,, \quad
\ttt = \nn \times \bb \,.
$${#eq-proof-frenet-1}
Differentiating the second equation in (@eq-proof-frenet-1) and using (@eq-proof-frenet-2)-(@eq-proof-frenet-3) we get
\begin{align*}
\dot{\nn} & = \dot{\bb} \times \ttt + \bb \times \dot{\ttt} & \\
          & = ( - \tau \nn \times \ttt) + \bb \times \kappa \nn \\
          & = \tau ( \ttt \times \nn ) - \kappa (\nn \times \bb ) \\
          & = \tau \bb - \kappa \ttt \,,
\end{align*}
where in the last equality we used the first and third equations in
(@eq-proof-frenet-1). The above is exactly the second Frenet-Serret equation.

:::


::: Remark
### Vectorial form of Frenet-Serret equations {#remark-vector-frenet}

We can write the Frenet-Serret ODE sysyem in vectorial form. Introduce the vector
of the Frenet frame
$$
\G = (\ttt, \nn, \bb)
$$
This way $\G$ is a $9$ dimensional time-dependent vector
$$
\G \colon (a,b) \to \R^9
$$
Also define the block matrix
$$
\mathbf{A} =
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\zero & \kappa I & \zero \\
- \kappa I & \zero & \tau I  \\
\zero & -\tau I & \zero 
\end{array}
\right) \,,
$$
where we denoted
$$
\zero :=
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0  \\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}
\right) \,, \quad 
I := \left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0  \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}
\right) \,.
$$
This way $\mathbf{A}$ is a $9 \times 9$ time-dependent matrix
$$
\mathbf{A} \colon (a,b) \to \R^{9 \times 9}
$$
It is immediate to check that the Frenet-Serret equations can be written as
$$
\dot{\G} = \mathbf{A} \G
$$


**Note:** The matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is anti-symmetric, that is
$$
\mathbf{A}^T = - \mathbf{A} \,.
$$
This observation will be crucial in proving the *Fundamental Theorem of Space Curves*, which is stated in the next section.


**Alternative Notation:** With a little abuse of notation we can also write the 
Frenet-Serret equations as
$$
\dot{\G} = A \G
$$
where $A$ is the $3 \times 3$ time-dependent matrix 
$$
A \colon (a,b) \to \R^{3 \times 3} \,, \quad A := \left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & \kappa  & 0 \\
- \kappa  & 0 & \tau  \\
0 & -\tau  & 0
\end{array}
\right)  \,,
$$
and where we think $\G$ as a 3 dimensional vector, with each component being a function $\ttt, \nn$ and $\bb$.

Note that the block in poisition $(i,j)$ of $\mathbf{A}$ is obtained by multiplying
by $I$ the entry $(i,j)$ of $A$.

## Fundamental Theorem of Space Curves

The most important consequence of the Frenet-Serret equations is that they allow to fully characterize space curves in terms of curvature and torsion. This is known as the *Fundamental Theorem of Space Curves* which can be informally stated as:

> If we prescribe two functions $\kappa(t)>0$ and $\tau(t)$, there exists a unit-speed curve $\g(t)$ which has curvature $\kappa(t)$ and torsion $\tau(t)$. Moreover $\gamma$ is the **only curve** with such curvature and torsion, up to rigid motions.


A rigid motion is a rotation about the origin,
followed by a translation. Therefore the Theorem is saying that there exists a unique $\g$ with curvature $\kappa$ and torsion $\tau$, up to rotations and translations.

Let us give the analytic definition of rigid motion.


::: Definition
### Rigid motion

A *rigid motion* of $\R^3$ is a map $M \colon \R^3 \to \R^3$ of the form
$$
M(\vv) = R \vv + \pp \,, \qquad \vv \in \R^3 \,,
$$
where $\pp \in \R^3$ is a vector and $R \in \R^{3 \times 3}$ is
a **rotation matrix**, i.e.,
$$
R \in \mathrm{SO}(3) := \{ R \in \R^{3 \times 3} \ \colon \ R^T R = I \,, \,\, \det(R) = 1 \} \,.
$$

:::

In the above definition $I$ is the identity matrix in $\R^3$
$$
I = 
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}
\right)
$$
It is also useful to introduce the set of **orthogonal matrices**
$$
\mathrm{O}(3) := \{ A \in \R^{3 \times 3} \ \colon \ A^T A = I \}
$$
Notice that for $A \in \mathrm{O}(3)$ we have
$$
\det(A) = \pm 1
$$
Therefore rotations are orthogonal matrices with deteminant $1$.

> Proof. We have
$$
1 = \det(I) = \det (A^T A) =  \det (A) \det (A^T) = \det (A)^2
$$
and therefore $\det(A) = \pm 1$.




The precise statement of the *Fundamental Theorem of Space Curves* is as follows.



::: Theorem
### Fundamental Theorem of Space Curves  {#theorem-characterization-space}

Let $\kappa, \tau \ \colon (a,b) \to \R$ be smooth functions, with $\kappa>0$. Then:

1. There exists a unit-speed curve $\g \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ with curvature $\kappa(t)$ and torsion $\tau(t)$.

2. Suppose that $\tg \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ is a unit-speed curve whose curvature $\tkappa$ and torsion $\ttau$ satisfy
$$
\tkappa(t) = \kappa(t) \,, \quad 
\ttau(t) = \tau(t) 
  \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
Then there exists a rigid motion $M \colon \R^3 \to \R^3$ such that
$$
\tg(t) = M (\g(t)) \,, \qquad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$

:::

In other words, curvature and torsion fully characterize space curves. This result is the 3D counterpart of
Theorem \ref{theorem-characterization-plane}, which said that signed curvature characterizes 2D curves.



The proof of Theorem \ref{theorem-characterization-space} is rather lengthy and technical. We delay it to the end of the chapter, see Section (@sec-FTSC-proof).
For now, let us show a simple application of Theorem \ref{theorem-characterization-space}.


::: Example
### Application of Fundamental Theorem of Curves

In Example \ref{example-circle-rotated} we have considered the unit-speed curve
$$
\g(t) := \left( \frac45 \cos(t),  1 - \sin(t) , -\frac35 \cos(t)  \right) \,,
$$
for $t \in [0,2\pi]$. We have computed that 
$$
\kappa = 1 \,, \quad \tau = 0 \,. 
$$
If we plot $\g$, we clearly see that $\g$ is just obtained by translating and 
rotating a unit circle, see plot in @fig-circle-rigid. Theorem \ref{theorem-characterization-space} enables
us to rigorously prove this claim. Indeed, consider the unit-speed circle
$$
\tg(t) := \left( \cos(t), \sin(t) , 0  \right) \,,
$$
for $t \in [0,2\pi]$. In Example \ref{example-circle-curvature-torsion} we have proven that curvature and torsion are  
$$
\tkappa = 1 \,, \quad \ttau = 0 \,. 
$$
Therefore 
$$
\kappa = \tkappa\,, \quad \tau = \ttau  \,,
$$
and by Theorem  \ref{theorem-characterization-space} we conclude that there exist a rigid motion $M \colon \R^3 \to \R^3$ such that
$$
\g(t) = M(\tg(t))  \,, \quad \forall \,  t \in [0,2\pi] \,.
$$

## Applications of Frenet-Serret


We now state and prove two results which directly follow from the Frenet-Serret equations. They state, respectively:

1. A curve has torsion $\tau = 0$ if and only if it is contained in a plane.

2. A curve has constant curvature $\kappa > 0$ and torsion $\tau = 0$ if and only if it is part of a circle.


Before proceeding, we recall the definition plane in $\R^3$.



::: Remark
### Equation of a plane

The general equation of a plane $\pmb{\pi}_d$ in $\R^3$ is given by

$$
\pmb{\pi}_d = \{ \xx \in \R^3 \, \colon \,  \xx \cdot \mathbf{P} = d \}\,,
$$
for some vector $\mathbf{P} \in \R^3$ and scalar $d \in \R$. Note that:

1. If $d = 0$, the condition
$$
\xx \cdot \mathbf{P} = 0
$$
is saying that the plane $\pmb{\pi}_0$ contains all the points $\xx$ in $\R^3$ which are orthogonal to $\mathbf{P}$. In particular $\pmb{\pi}_0$ contains the origin $\zero$. 

2. If $d \neq 0$, then $\pmb{\pi}_d$ is the translation of $\pmb{\pi}_0$ by the quantity $d$ in direction $\mathbf{P}$.

 In both cases, $\mathbf{P}$ is the normal vector to the plane, as shown in @fig-general-plane.
:::

::: {.Proposition  #proposition-zero-torsion}

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be regular and such that $\kappa \neq 0$. They are equivalent:


1. The torsion of $\g$ satisfies 
$$
\tau(t) = 0 \,, \quad \forall  \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$

2. The image of $\g$ is contained in a plane, that is, there exists a vector $\mathbf{P} \in \R^3$ and a scalar $d \in \R$ such that
$$
\g(t)\cdot \mathbf{P} = d \,, \quad \forall t \in (a,b) \,.
$$


:::


**Idea of the proof:**
The third Frenet-Serret equation states that
$$
\dot{\bb} = - \tau \nn 
$$
Therefore $\tau=0$ if and only if $\dot{\bb} = 0$, which means
that $\bb$ is constant. Now, $\bb$ is orthogonal to the other 
two vectors $\ttt, \nn$ of the Frenet-Frame. Since $\bb$ is constant, this means $\ttt, \nn$ span a constant plane which has $\bb$ as normal vector. This tells us $\g$ is contained in the plane
$$
\g \cdot \bb = d 
$$
for suitable $d \in \R$. Let's prove this!
 

::: Proof

Without loss of generality we can assume that $\g$ is unit-speed. 

> Proof. If we were to consider $\tg$ a unit-speed reparametrization of $\g$, then $\tg$ would still be contained in the same plane as $\g$ is contained.
Moreover curvature and torsion are invariante under reparametrization, and so $\tg$ would still have non-zero curvature and identically zero torsion.


As $\g$ is unit-speed, it is well defined the Frenet frame
$$
\{ \ttt(t), \nn(t) ,\bb(t) \} \,.
$$


*Step 1.* Suppose $\tau = 0$ for all $t$. By the third Frenet-Serret equation
$$
\dot{\bb} = -\tau(t) \nn = \zero \,,
$$
so that $\bb(t)$ is constant. As by definition 
$$
\bb = \ttt \times \nn \,,
$$ 
we conclude that the vectors $\ttt(t)$ and $\nn(t)$ always span the same plane, which has constant normal vector $\bb$. Intuition suggests that $\g$ should be contained in such plane, see Figure @fig-proof-plane. Indeed
$$
\frac{d}{dt} ( \g \cdot \bb ) = \dg \cdot \bb + \ddg \cdot \dot{\bb} = 0\,,
$$
where we used that $\dot{\bb}=0$ and that the Frenet frame is orthonormal, i.e.
$$
\dg \cdot \bb = \ttt \cdot \bb = 0 \,.
$$
Thus $\g \cdot \bb$ has zero derivative, meaning it is constant: there exists $d \in \R$ such that
$$
\g(t) \cdot \bb = d \,, \,\, \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$${#eq-plane-conclusion}
This shows that $\g$ is conatained in a plane orthogonal to $\bb$, and the first part of the proof is concluded.



*Step 2.* Suppose that $\g$ is contained in a plane. Hence there exists $\mathbf{P} \in \R^3$ and $d \in \R$ such that 
$$
\g(t)\cdot \mathbf{P} = d \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
We can differentiate the above equation twice to obtain
$$
\dg \cdot \mathbf{P} = 0 \,, \quad   \ddg \cdot \mathbf{P} = 0 \,,
$$
where we used that $\mathbf{P}$ and $d$ are constant. The first equation says that
$\dg(t)$ is orthogonal to $\mathbf{P}$.
By the first Frenet-Serret equation we have
$$
\ddg (t)= \dot{\ttt} = \kappa (t) \nn (t) \,.
$$
Therefore the already proven relation $\ddg \cdot \mathbf{P} = 0$ implies
$$
\kappa (t) \nn (t) \cdot \mathbf{P} = 0 \,.
$$
As we are assuming $\kappa \neq 0$, we deduce that
$$
\nn (t) \cdot \mathbf{P} = 0 \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
In conclusion, we have shown that $\mathbf{P}$ is orthogonal to both $\dg(t)$ and $\nn(t)$. Since $\bb(t)$ is orthogonal to both $\dg(t)$ and $\nn(t)$, we conclude that $\bb(t)$ is parallel to $\mathbf{P}$. Hence, there exists $\lambda(t) \in \R$ such that
$$
\bb(t) = \lambda(t) \mathbf{P} \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
Since $\norm{\bb} = 1$ and $\mathbf{P}$ is constant, from (@eq-proof-plane) we conclude that $\lambda(t)$ is constant
and non-zero. Thus
$$
\bb(t) = \hat{\lambda} \mathbf{P} \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,,
$${#eq-proof-plane}
for some $\hat{\lambda} \neq 0$. Differentiating (@eq-proof-plane) we obtain
$$
\dot{\bb}(t) = 0 \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,,
$$
meaning that the binormal $\bb$ is a constant vector. By definition of torsion
$$
\tau(t) = - \dot{\bb} \cdot \nn(t) = 0 \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,,
$$
as required.

![If $\bb$ is constant, then $\g$ lies in the plane spanned by $\dg$ and $\nn$. Note that $\bb$ is the unit normal to such plane.](/images/proof_plane_intuition.png){#fig-proof-plane width=70%}



As a corollary of Step 1 in the proof of Proposition \ref{proposition-zero-torsion}
we obtain the following statement.


::: {.Corollary  #corollary-zero-torsion}

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be regular and such that $\kappa \neq 0$. Suppose that
the torsion
$$
\tau(t) = 0 \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b)\,.
$$
Then the binormal $\bb$ is a constant vector, and the image of $\g$ is contained in the plane of equation
$$
(\xx - \g(t_0)) \cdot \bb = 0 \,,
$$
where $t_0 \in (a,b)$ is arbitrarily chosen. Note that such plane is orthogonal to the binormal $\bb$.

:::


::: Proof

Following the proof of Step 1 of Proposition \ref{proposition-zero-torsion}, 
we get to the conclusion (@eq-plane-conclusion) that $\g$ satisfies
$$
\g(t) \cdot \bb = d \,, \,\, \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
As the above equation holds for each $t$, we can fix an arbitrary $t_0 \in (a,b)$ and
find that the constant $d$ is
$$
d = \g(t_0) \cdot \bb 
$$
Hence we obtain
$$
(\g(t) - \g(t_0)) \cdot \bb = 0 \,, \,\, \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
The above is says that $\g$ is contained in the plane (orthogonal to $\bb$) with equation
$$
(\xx - \g(t_0)) \cdot \bb = 0
$$

:::


::: Example 

Consider again the curve of Example \ref{example-circle-rotated}
$$
\g(t) := \left( \frac45 \cos(t),  1 - \sin(t) , -\frac35 \cos(t)  \right) \,,
$$
for $t \in \R$. Recall that $\g$ is a Circle which has been rotated an translated, as shown in @fig-circle-rigid. We have
already proven in Example \ref{example-circle-rotated} that the curvature and torsion satisfy
$$
\kappa = 1 \,, \qquad \tau = 0 \,.  
$$
Since $\kappa \neq 0$ and $\tau=0$, we can apply Corollary \ref{corollary-zero-torsion} and infer that $\g$ is contained in the plane of equation
$$
	(\xx - \g(t_0)) \cdot \bb = 0 \,, \quad \xx \in \R^3 \,,
$$
where $\bb$ is the binormal vector to $\g$. As computed in Example \ref{example-circle-rotated} we have
$$
\bb =  \left( -\frac35, 0, -\frac45 \right) \,.
$$
Next, we take a point on the curve. At $t = \pi/2$ we have
$$
\g(0) = \zero 
$$
The equation of the plane is then
$$
-\frac{3}{5} x -  \frac{4}{5} z = 0
$$
Simplifying, we obtain that $\g$ is contained in the plane of equation
$$
3x + 4z = 0 \, .
$$
:::






We now state and prove the second result anticipated at the beginning of this section.


::: {.Proposition #proposition-constant-k-zero-t}

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be a unit-speed curve. They are equivalent:


1. The image of $\g$ is contained in a circle of radius $1/c$.


2. The curvature and torsion of $\g$ satisfy
$$
\kappa (t) = c \,, \quad  \tau(t) = 0\,,  \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b)\,, 
$$
for some constant $c > 0$.


:::


Proposition \ref{proposition-constant-k-zero-t} is actually a consequence of the Fundamental Theorem of Space Curves Theorem 
\ref{theorem-characterization-space}, and of the fact that we have computed 
that for a circle of radius $R$ one has
$$
\kappa  = \frac1R \,, \quad  \tau = 0\,.
$$
Therefore, by Theorem \ref{theorem-characterization-space}, every unit-speed curve $\g$ with
constant curvature and torsion must be equal to a circle, up to rigid motions. 

Nevertheless, we still give a proof of Proposition \ref{proposition-constant-k-zero-t}, 
to show yet another explicit application of the Frenet-Serret equations.


::: Proof
*Step 1.* Suppose the image of $\g$ is contained in a circle of radius $1/c$. Then, up to a translation, $\g$ is parametrized by 
$$
\g(t) = \left( \frac{1}{c} \cos(t) ,   \frac{1}{c} \sin(t) , 0 \right) \,.
$$
We have already seen that in this case
$$
\kappa = c  \,, \quad \tau = 0 \,,
$$
concluding the proof.


*Step 2.* Suppose that 
$$
\kappa (t) = c \,, \quad  \tau(t) = 0\,,  \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b)\,, 
$$
for some constant $c \in \R$. Since $\g$ is unit-speed, it is well defined the 
Frenet frame 
$$
\{ \ttt, \nn ,\bb \} \,.
$$
Due to the assumptions on $\kappa$ and $\tau$ the Frenet-Serret equations read
\begin{align*}
\dot{\ttt} & = \kappa \nn = c \nn \\
\dot{\nn} & = - \kappa \ttt + \tau \bb = -c \ttt \\
\dot{\bb} & = -\tau \nn = \zero  
\end{align*}
In particular $\dot{\bb}=\zero$ and so $\bb$ is a constant vector. As seen in the proof Proposition \ref{proposition-zero-torsion}, this implies that $\g$ is contained in a plane $\p$ orthogonal to $\bb$, see @fig-proof-plane. As $c$ is constant we get
$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left(  \g  + \frac1c \nn   \right)  = \dg + \frac{1}{c} \dot{\nn} = \ttt - \frac1c 
\, c \ttt = 0 \,,
$$
where we used that $\dg = \ttt$ and the second Frenet-Serret equation. Therefore 
$$ 
\g(t)  + \frac1c \nn(t) = \pp \,, \quad  t \in (a,b) \,,
$$
for some constant point $\pp \in \R^3$. In particular
$$
\norm{ \g(t) - \pp } =   \norm{  -\frac1c \nn(t) } =  \frac{1}{|c|} = \frac1c \,,
$$
since $\nn$ is a unit vector and $c>0$. The above shows that $\g$ is contained in a sphere of radius $1/c$ and center $\pp$. In formulas:
$$
\g(t) \in \SSS := \{  \xx \in \R^3 \, \colon \,  \norm{\xx - \pp} = 1/c    \} \,.
$$
The intersection of $\SSS$ with the plane $\p$ is a circle $\mathcal{C}$ with some radius $R \geq 0$ (note that $\mathcal{C}$ might be a single point, in which case $R = 0$).
As we have shown 
$$
\g \in  \p \,, \quad \g \in \SSS \,,
$$
we conclude that
$$
\g \in   \p  \cap \SSS  = \mathcal{C} \,.
$${#eq-proof-contained-circle}
Therefore $\g$ parametrizes part of $\mathcal{C}$. This immediately implies that
$R > 0$.

> Proof. If $R = 0$ then $\mathcal{C}$ is a single point, meaning that $\g$ is constant. But then $\dg = 0$ which contradicts the assumption that $\g$ is unit speed.

Since $\mathcal{C}$ is a circle of radius $R>0$, Step 1 of the proof implies that the curvature and torsion of $\g$ satisfy
$$
\kappa = \frac1R \,, \quad \tau = 0 \,.
$$
As by assumption $\kappa=c$, we conclude that $R=1/c$. Therefore the circle $\mathcal{C}$ has radius $1/c$ and the thesis follows by (@eq-proof-contained-circle).

## Proof: Curvature and torsion formulas

Another consequence of the Frenet-Serret equations is that they allow us to finally 
prove the curvature and torsion formulas given in Proposition \ref{proposition-curvature-formula} and Proposition \ref{proposition-torsion-formula}. For reader's convenience we recall these two results.


::: Proposition 
### Curvature and torsion formulas  {#proposition-curvature-torsion-formulas}

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be a regular curve. The curvature $\kappa(t)$ of $\g$ at $\g(t)$ is given by
$$
\kappa(t) = \frac{ \norm{\dg \times \ddg} }{ \norm{\dg}^3 } \,. 
$${#eq-curv-proof}
If $\kappa >0$ the torsion $\tau(t)$ of $\g$ at $\g(t)$ is given by
$$
\tau (t) = \frac{ ( \dg \times \ddg ) \cdot \dddg }{ \norm{ \dg \times \ddg }^2 } \,. 
$${#eq-torsion-proof}

:::



::: Proof

By assumption $\g$ is regular. Denote by $\tg = \g \circ s^{-1}$ the arc-length reparametrization. As $\tg$ is unit-speed, it is well defined its Frenet frame
$$
\left\{\tttt (s), \tnn (s), \tbb (s) \right\}  \,, \quad \tttt =\dtg 
$$
The Frenet-Serret equations are
\begin{align*}
\dot{\tttt} & = \tkappa \ \tnn \\
\dot{ \tnn } & = - \tkappa \ \tttt + \ttau \ \tbb \\
\dot{\tbb} & = - \ttau \ \tnn
\end{align*}
where $\tkappa$ and $\ttau$ are the curvature and torsion of $\tg$.



*Part 1.* Differentiating $\g = \tg \circ s$ we get
$$
\dg(t) = \dtg(s(t)) \ \dot{s}(t) = \tttt (s(t)) \ \dot{s}(t)
$$
Differentiating once more
$$
\begin{aligned}
\ddg (t) & = \frac{d}{dt} \left[ \tttt (s(t)) \ \dot{s}(t)   \right] \\
                    & =  \dot{\tttt} \dot{s}^2  +  \tttt \, \ddot{s}  \\
                    & =  \tkappa \ \tnn \ \dot{s}^2  +  \tttt \, \ddot{s}
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-prop-curvature-torsion-1}
where in the last line we used the first Frenet-Serret equation. We are also omitting the dependence on the point for brevity. We compute
$$
\begin{aligned}
\dg(t) \times \ddg (t) & =   \tttt \ \dot{s} \times  \left[  \tkappa \ \tnn \  \dot{s}^2  +  \tttt \ \ddot{s} \right] \\
& = \dot{s}^3 \ \tkappa \ \tttt \times \tnn +
\dot{s} \ \ddot{s} \ \tttt \times \tttt \\
& = \dot{s}^3 \ \tkappa \ \tbb
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-prop-curvature-torsion}
where we used that $\tbb = \tttt \times \tnn$ by definition, and that $\tttt \times \tttt = 0$ by the properties of the cross product. Taking the norms in (@eq-prop-curvature-torsion) gives
$$
\norm{ \dg(t) \times \ddg (t) } =   \norm{ \g(t) }^3 \ \tkappa(s(t)) 
$$
where we used that $\norm{\tbb} = 1$ and $\dot{s} (t) = \norm{ \g(t) }$.
Rearranging we get
$$
\tkappa(s(t)) = \frac{ \norm{ \dg(t) \times \ddg (t) } }{ \norm{ \g(t) }^3 }
$$
Recalling that the curvature $\kappa$ of $\g$ at $t$ is defined as
$$
\kappa(t) = \tkappa( s(t) )
$$
we conclude (@eq-curv-proof).


*Part 2*. Differentiating the second line in  (@eq-prop-curvature-torsion-1) we get
$$
\begin{aligned}
\dddot{\g}(t) & = \frac{d}{dt} \left[ \dot{\tttt}(s(t)) \dot{s}^2(t)  +  \tttt(s(t)) \, \ddot{s}(t) \right] \\
              & = \ddot{\tttt} \dot{s}^3 + 2\dot{\tttt} \dot{s} \ddot{s} + \dot{\tttt} \dot{s} \ddot{s} + \tttt \ \dddot{s} \\
              & = \ddot{\tttt} \dot{s}^3 + 3\dot{\tttt} \dot{s} \ddot{s} + \tttt \ \dddot{s} 
\end{aligned}
$$
Therefore, using (@eq-prop-curvature-torsion), we get
$$
\begin{aligned}
\left( \dg \times \ddg  \right) \cdot \dddot{\g} & = 
\left[\dot{s}^3 \tkappa \ \tbb \right] \cdot 
\left [ \ddot{\tttt} \dot{s}^3 + 3\dot{\tttt} \dot{s} \ddot{s} + \tttt \ \dddot{s} \right] \\
& = \dot{s}^6 \ \tkappa \  \tbb \cdot  \ddot{\tttt} +
3\dot{s}^4  \ \ddot{s} \ \tkappa \ \tbb \cdot \dot{\tttt}  +
\dot{s}^3 \ \dddot{s} \  \tkappa \ \tbb \cdot \tttt \\
& =  \dot{s}^6 \ \tkappa \  \tbb \cdot  \ddot{\tttt}
\end{aligned} 
$${#eq-prop-curvature-torsion-2}
where the second term is zero by the first Frenet-Serret equation
$$
\tbb \cdot \dot{\tttt} = \tkappa \ \tbb \cdot \tnn = 0 \,,
$$
as $\tbb \cdot \tnn = 0$, and the thrid term is zero because  $\tbb \cdot \tttt = 0$. To compute $\ddot{\tttt}$ we differentiate the first Frenet-Serret formula
$$
\begin{aligned}
\ddot{\tttt} & = \frac{d}{ds} \left[ \dot{\tttt}  \right] \\
             & = \frac{d}{ds} \left[ \tkappa  \ \tnn \right] \\
             & = \dot{\tkappa}  \ \tnn + \tkappa  \ \dot{\tnn}  
\end{aligned}
$$
Substituting in (@eq-prop-curvature-torsion-2) we get
$$
\begin{aligned}
\left( \dg \times \ddg  \right) \cdot \dddot{\g} 
& = \dot{s}^6 \ \tkappa \  \tbb \cdot  \ddot{\tttt} \\
& = \dot{s}^6 \ \tkappa \  \tbb \cdot \left[ \dot{\tkappa}  \ \tnn + \tkappa  \ \dot{\tnn}  \right] \\
& = \dot{s}^6 \ \tkappa \ \dot{\tkappa} \  \tbb \cdot \tnn +
\dot{s}^6 \ \tkappa^2 \ \tbb \cdot  \dot{\tnn} \\
& = \dot{s}^6 \ \tkappa^2 \ \tbb \cdot  \dot{\tnn}
\end{aligned}
$$
where we used that $\tbb \cdot \tnn = 0$. Using the second Frenet-Serret equation we get
$$
\begin{aligned}
\left( \dg \times \ddg  \right) \cdot \dddot{\g} 
& = \dot{s}^6 \ \tkappa^2 \ \tbb \cdot  \dot{\tnn} \\
& = \dot{s}^6 \ \tkappa^2 \ \tbb \cdot \left[  -\tkappa \ \tttt + \ttau \ \tbb  \right] \\
& = -  \dot{s}^6 \ \tkappa^3 \ \tbb \cdot \tttt + \dot{s}^6 \ \tkappa^2 \ \ttau \ \tbb \cdot \tbb \\
& = \dot{s}^6 \ \tkappa^2 \ \ttau
\end{aligned}
$$
where we used that $\tbb \cdot \tttt = 0$ and $\tbb \cdot \tbb = 1$. Recalling that $\dot s = \norm{\dg}$, and using the already proven formula (@eq-curv-proof), we get
$$
\begin{aligned}
\left( \dg \times \ddg  \right) \cdot \dddot{\g}  & = \dot{s}^6 \ \tkappa^2 \ \ttau \\
& = \norm{\tg}^6 \ \frac{ \norm{\dg \times \ddg}^2 }{ \norm{\dg}^6 }   \ \ttau \\
& = \norm{\dg \times \ddg}^2 \ \ttau
\end{aligned}
$$
Rerranging we get
$$
\ttau (s(t)) = \frac{ \left( \dg(t) \times \ddg(t)  \right) \cdot \dddot{\g}(t) }{ \norm{\dg(t) \times \ddg(t)}^2  }
$$
Recalling that the torsion $\tau$ of $\g$ at $t$ is defined as
$$
\tau(t) = \ttau ( s(t) )
$$
we conclude (@eq-torsion-proof).

:::





::: {.content-hidden}

Before proceeding with the proof, we need to establish some notation.

::: Notation
### Compact notation for derivatives


Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^n$ be a regular curve and
$s \colon (a,b) \to (\tilde{a},\tilde{b})$ its arc-length
function. Denote by
$$
\tg := \g \circ s^{-1}
$$
the arc-length reparametrization of $\g$. 
In the previous Chapter we used the letters:

1. $s$ to denote the *arc-length parameter*
2. $t$ to denote an *arbitrary parameter*

With this choice the parameter of the arc-length function is $t$
$$
s = s(t)
$$
and the parameter of the inverse $\psi := s^{-1}$ of the arc-length is $s$
$$
\psi = \psi (s)
$$
We equivalently denote the inverse of $s$ by
$$
t = t(s)
$$
In particular the relations $\g = \tg \circ s$ and $\tg = \g \circ s^{-1}$ read
$$
\g (t) = \tg(s(t)) \,, \quad t \in (a,b)
$$
and also
$$
\tg (s) = \g(t(s)) \,, \quad s \in (\tilde{a},\tilde{b}) 
$$

We will denote:

1. The derivative of the arc-length function $s(t)$ by
$$
\dot s(t) = \frac{ds}{dt}(t)
$$

2. The derivative of the inverse of the arc-length function $t(s)$ by
$$
\dot t(s) = \frac{dt}{ds}(s)
$$

Moreover:

- The derivative of $\g(t)$ is denoted by 
$$
\dg(t) = \frac{d\g}{dt}(t)  \,, \quad  t \in (a,b)
$$

- The derivative of $\tg(s)$ is denoted by
$$
\dtg(s) = \frac{d\tg}{ds}(s)  \,, \quad  s \in (\tilde{a},\tilde{b}) \,.
$$


According to the above notations, this is how we can write the **chain rule**:

- The chain rule for $\g = \tg \circ s$ is the old notations is:
$$
\dg(t) = \dtg(s(t)) \, \dot{s} (t) \,, \quad t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
In the new notations the above chain rule is written
$$
\frac{d\g}{dt}(t) = \frac{d\tg}{ds}(s(t)) \, \frac{ds}{dt}(t) \,, \quad t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
We will often omit the dependence on the point $t$ by writing
$$
\frac{d\g}{dt} = \frac{d\tg}{ds} \, \frac{ds}{dt} 
$$

- The chain rule for $\tg = \g \circ s^{-1}$ in the old notation is:
$$
\dtg(s) = \dg( t(s) ) \, \dot{t}(s) \,, \quad 
s \in (\tilde{a},\tilde{b}) \,.
$$
In the new notations the above chain rule is written
$$
\frac{d\tg}{ds}(s) = \frac{d\g}{dt}( t(s) )  \, \frac{dt}{ds} ( s ) \,,\quad s \in (\ta,\tb) \,,
$$
Omitting the dependence on the point $s$, the above reads
$$
\frac{d\tg}{ds} = \frac{d\g}{dt} \, \frac{dt}{ds} 
$$
:::


::: Example 
### How to use the new notations

Let $\g$ be regular and $\tg := \g \circ s^{-1}$ an arc-length reparametrization fo $\g$. We already know that $\tg$ is unit-speed:
$$
\norm{\dtg(s)} = 1\,, \quad \forall \, s \in (\tilde{a}, \tilde{b})  \,.
$${#eq-new-notations-1}
As an exercise, let us prove (@eq-new-notations-1) using the new notations. By chain rule we have
$$
\begin{aligned}
\norm{\dtg(s)} & = \norm{ \frac{d\tg}{ds} (s) } \\
               & = \norm{\frac{d\g}{dt} (t(s))} \, \left| \frac{dt}{ds}(s) \right|
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-new-notations-2bis}
Now, recall that 
$$
\frac{ds}{dt}(t) = \dot{s}(t) = \norm{\dg (t)}
= \norm{ \frac{d\g}{dt} (t) }
$${#eq-new-notations-2}
As $t$ is the inverse of $s$, by the inverse function theorem we get
$$
\frac{dt}{ds}(s) = \frac{1}{\left(\dfrac{ds}{dt} (t(s)) \right)} = \frac{ 1 }{ \norm{ \dfrac{d\g}{dt} (t(s)) } }
$$
where we used (@eq-new-notations-2) evaluated at $t(s)$. From (@eq-new-notations-2bis)
\begin{align*}
\norm{\dtg(s)} & = \norm{\frac{d\g}{dt} (t(s))} \, \left| \frac{dt}{ds}(s) \right| \\
              & = \norm{\frac{d\g}{dt} (t(s))}  \frac{1}{\norm{\dfrac{d\g}{dt} (t(s))} } = 1
\end{align*}
concluding (@eq-new-notations-1).

We will heavily rely on the new notations for proving Proposition \ref{proposition-curvature-torsion-formulas}.

## Proof: Fundamental Theorem of Space Curves {#sec-FTSC-proof}


In this section we prove the *Fundamental Theorem of Space Curves* Theorem \ref{theorem-characterization-space}. For reader's convenience we recall the statement.



::: Theorem
### Fundamental Theorem of Space Curves  {#theorem-FTSC}

Let $\kappa, \tau \ \colon (a,b) \to \R$ be smooth functions, with $\kappa>0$. Then:

1. There exists a unit-speed curve $\g \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ with curvature $\kappa(t)$ and torsion $\tau(t)$.

2. Suppose that $\tg \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ is a unit-speed curve whose curvature $\tkappa$ and torsion $\ttau$ satisfy
$$
\tkappa(t) = \kappa(t) \,, \quad 
\ttau(t) = \tau(t) 
  \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
Then there exists a rigid motion $M \colon \R^3 \to \R^3$ such that
$$
\tg(t) = M (\g(t)) \,, \qquad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$

The proof relies on the following classical existence Theorem for linear systems of ODEs. For a proof see Page 162 in [@walter].


::: Theorem
### Existence and uniqueness for linear ODE systems

Assume given a point $t_0 \in (a,b)$, a vector $\uu_0 \in \R^n$ and two functions

f \colon (a,b) \to \R^n
$$
of class $C^k$. There exists a unique function
$$
\uu \colon (a,b) \to \R^n
$$
of class $C^{k+1}$ which solves the Cauchy problem
$$
\begin{cases}

We will also need the following 4 Propositions. The first Proposition states
that orthogonal matrices preserve scalar product and length.


::: Proposition
### Orthogonal matrices preserve scalar product and length

Let $A \in \mathrm{O}(3)$ and $\vv,\ww \in \R^3$. Then
$$
A \vv \cdot A \ww = \vv \cdot \ww 
$${#eq-orthogonal-dot}
and also
$$
\norm{A \vv} = \| \vv \| 
$${#eq-orthogonal-length}

:::

::: Proof

For $\vv, \ww \in \R^3$
$$
A \vv \cdot A \ww = A^T A \vv \cdot \ww = \vv \cdot \ww
$$
where we used the properties of scalar product and that $A^T A = I$. 
In particular the above implies
$$
\norm{A \vv} = \sqrt{ A \vv \cdot A \vv} = \sqrt{ \vv \cdot  \vv}  = \| \vv \|
$$
concluding the proof.

We now inverstigate how the cross product behaves under linear transformations, i.e.,
how the cross product of two vector changes under matrix multiplication.


::: Proposition
### Linear transformations of cross product

Let $A \in \R^{3 \times 3}$ be invertible and $\vv,\ww \in \R^3$. Then
$$
A \vv \times A \ww = \det(A) \left(A^{-1}\right)^{T} \left( \vv \times \ww \right) 
$${#eq-matrix-cross}
In particular for $R \in \mathrm{SO}(3)$ we have
$$
R \vv \times R \ww = R \left( \vv \times \ww \right)
$${#eq-rotation-cross}

:::

::: Proof

*Part 1.* Recall that the inverse of a matrix $A$ is computed by
$$
A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det A}(\operatorname{cof} A)^{T}
$$
where $\operatorname{cof} M$ is the matrix of cofactors. 
By linearity of the cross product we only need to verify (@eq-matrix-cross)
on the vectors of the orthonormal basis $\ee_1,\ee_2,\ee_3$.
Let us verify (@eq-matrix-cross) for $\vv = \ee_1$ and $\ww = \ee_2$. Writing
$A\ee_1$ and $A\ee_2$ in coordinates
$$
A \ee_1 = \sum_{i=1}^3 m_{i 1}  \ee_i \,, \quad 
A \ee_2 = \sum_{i=1}^3 m_{i 2}  \ee_i
$$
for some coefficients $m_{i 1}, m_{i 2} \in \R$. By the formula for computing the vector product
(@eq-formula-cross-product) and definition of cofactor matrix
$$
\begin{aligned}
A \ee_1 \times A \ee_2 & = 
\sum_{i=1}^3 m_{i 1} \ee_i \times \sum_{j=1}^3 m_{j 2} \ee_{j} \\
& =\sum_{i<j} 
\left|\begin{array}{ll}
m_{i 1} & m_{i 2} \\
m_{j 1} & m_{j 2}
\end{array} \right| \ee_i \times \ee_j \\
& = \sum_{i=1}^3 (\operatorname{cof} \boldsymbol{A})_{i 3} \ee_i  \\
& = (\operatorname{cof} \boldsymbol{A}) \ee_3 \\
& =(\operatorname{det} A)\left(A^{-1}\right)^{T} \ee_3 \\
& =(\operatorname{det} A)\left(A^{-1}\right)^{T}\left(\ee_1 \times \ee_2\right)
\end{aligned}
$$
Calculations for the other cases are similar.

*Part 2.* For $R \in \mathrm{SO}(3)$ it holds $\det (R) = 1$. Moreover
$R^T R = I$, so that 
$$
R^{-1}= R^T \quad \implies \quad 
\left(R^{-1}\right)^{T} = R
$$
Therefore (@eq-rotation-cross) follows from (@eq-matrix-cross).

We need to clarify how unit-speed curves and Frenet frame behave
under rigid motions.


::: Proposition
### Frenet Frame under rigid motions

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be unit-speed and $M \colon \R^3 \to \R^3$ be a rigid motion, i.e. such that 
$$
M(\vv) = R \, \vv + \pp 
$$
for some $R \in \mathrm{SO}(3)$ and $\pp \in \R^3$. Define the curve 
$$
\tg \colon (a,b) \to \R^3 \,, \qquad 
\tg(t) = M(\g(t)) \,.
$$
Then $\tg$ is unit-speed. Moreover the Frenet frame of $\tg$ is obtained by 
rotating the Frenet frame of $\g$ by $R$
$$
\tttt = R \, \ttt \,, \qquad
\tnn = R \, \nn  \,, \qquad 
\tbb = R \, \bb \,, \qquad
$${#eq-rigid-motion-frenet}

:::


::: Proof

Differentiating $\tg = M(\g) = R \, \g + \pp$ gives
$$
\dtg(t) = R \ \dg(t) \,, \qquad 
\ddtg(t) = R \ \ddg(t)
$$
Taking the norms in $\dtg = R \dg$ gives
$$
\norm{\dtg} = \norm{ R \dg } = \norm{\dg} = 1
$$
where we used that rotations preseve norms, see (@eq-orthogonal-length),
and the assumption of $\g$ unit-speed. This concludes the proof that $\tg$ is unit-speed.

Let us now prove (@eq-rigid-motion-frenet). The relation $\dtg = R \ \dg$ reads
$$
\tttt = R \, \ttt \,,
$$
which gives the first equation in (@eq-rigid-motion-frenet).
Since $\ddtg = R \ \ddg$, by (@eq-orthogonal-length) we deduce
$$
\norm{ \ddtg } = \norm{ R \ \ddg } = \norm{ \ddg }
$$
Therefore, by definition of principal normal,
$$
\tnn = \frac{ \ddtg }{ \norm{\ddtg} } = 
\frac{R \ \ddg}{\norm{ \ddg }} = R \, \nn \,,
$$
obtaining the second equation in (@eq-rigid-motion-frenet). Finally,
by definition of binormal and the first two equations in (@eq-rigid-motion-frenet),
$$
\tbb = \tttt \times \tnn
            = R \ \ttt \times R \ \nn
            = R \, (\ttt \times \nn)
            = R \, \bb
$$
where in the third equality we used (@eq-rotation-cross). The proof is concluded.

We are finally ready to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Curves.


::: Proof
### Proof of Theorem \ref{theorem-FTSC}

*Part 1. Existence of $\g$*.

Let 
$$
(\ttt_0, \nn_0, \bb_0)
$$ 
be an orthonormal basis of $\R^3$ with positive orientation. By the properties of vector product we immediately conclude that 
$$
\bb_0 = \ttt_0 \times \nn_0
$$

> Proof. By assumption $\bb_0$ is a unit vector orthogonal to both 
$\ttt_0$ and $\nn_0$. Since $\ttt_0$ and $\nn_0$ are unit vectors,
by the properties of vector product we know that also 
$\ttt_0 \times \nn_0$ is a unit vector orthogonal to $\ttt_0$ and $\nn_0$.
Therefore
$$
\bb_0 = \lambda \ttt_0 \times \nn_0  \,, \qquad  \lambda = \pm 1
$$
and we get
$$
\det (\ttt_0 | \nn_0 | \bb_0) = \lambda \det(\ttt_0 | \nn_0 | \ttt_0 \times \nn_0 ) = \lambda \,,
$$
where in the second equality we used that 
$$
(\ttt_0, \nn_0, \ttt_0 \times \nn_0 )
$$ 
is an orthonormal basis of $\R^3$ with positive orientation, due to the properties of vector product. Hence $(\ttt_0, \nn_0, \bb_0)$ has positive orientation if and only if $\lambda = 1$ from which we get
$$ 
\bb_0 = \ttt_0 \times \nn_0
$$



*Part 2. Uniqueness up to rigid motions.*
