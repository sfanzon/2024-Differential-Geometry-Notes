# Topology


So far we have worked in $\R^n$, where for example we have the notions of open set, continuous function and compact set. Topology is what allows us to extend these notions to arbitrary sets.



::: Definition
### Topological space   {#definition-topology}

Let $X$ be a set and $\TT$ a collection of subsets of $X$. We say that $\TT$ is a **topology** on $X$ if the following 3 properties hold:

- (A1) We have $\emptyset, X \in \TT$,

- (A2) If $\{A_i\}_{i \in I}$ is an arbitrary family of elements of $\TT$, then
$$
\bigcup_{i \in I} A_i  \in \TT \,.
$$

- (A3) If $A,B \in \TT$ then
$$
A \cap B \in \TT \,.
$$

Further, we say:

- The pair $(X,\TT)$ is a **topological space**.
- The elements of $X$ are called **points**.
- The sets in the topology $\TT$ are called **open sets**.
:::




::: {.Remark  #remark-intersection}

The intersection property of $\TT$, Property (A3) in Definition \ref{definition-topology}, is 
equivalent to the following:

- (A3') If $A_1, \ldots, A_M \in \TT$ for some $M \in \N$, then
$$
\bigcap_{n=1}^M A_n  \in \TT \,.
$$

> The equivalence between (A3) and (A3') can be immediately obtained by induction.

:::





::: Warning

Notice:

- The union property (A2) of $\TT$ holds for an **arbitrary** number of sets, even uncountable!
- The intersection property (A3') of $\TT$ holds only for a **finite** number of sets. 

:::



There are two main examples of topologies that one should always keep in mind. 
These are:

- **Trivial topology**: The topology with the smallest possible number of sets.
- **Discrete topology**: The topology with the highest possible number of sets.




::: Definition
### Trivial topology

Let $X$ be a set. The trivial topology on $X$ is the topology $\TT$ defined by
$$
\TT := \{  \emptyset , X \} \,.
$$

> Let us check that $\TT$ is indeed a topology. We need to verify the 3 properties of a topology:
>
>  - (A1) We clearly have $\emptyset , X \in \TT$.
>  - (A2) The only non-trivial union to check is the one between $\emptyset$ and $X$. We have
>  $$
    \emptyset \cup X = X \in \TT \,. 
>  $$ 
>  - (A3) The only non-trivial intersection to check is the one between $\emptyset$ and $X$. We have
>  $$
    \emptyset \cap X = \emptyset \in \TT \,. 
>  $$ 
>
> Therefore $\TT$ is a topology on $X$.
:::





::: Definition
### Discrete topology

Let $X$ be a set. The discrete topology on $X$ is the topology $\TT$ defined by
$$
\TT := \{ A \divider A \subseteq X \} \,,
$$
that is, every subset of $X$ is open.

> Let us check that $\TT$ is a topology: 
>
>  - (A1) We have $\emptyset , X \in \TT$, since $\emptyset$ and $X$ are subsets of $X$.
>  - (A2) The arbitrary union of subsets of $X$ is still a subset of $X$. Therefore
>  $$
>  \bigcup_{i \in I} A_i \in \TT \,, 
>  $$
>  whenever $A_i \in \TT$ for all $i \in I$.
>
>  - (A3) The intersection of two subsets of $X$ is still a subset of $X$. Therefore
>  $$
>  A \cap B \in \TT \,, 
>  $$
>  whenever $A, B  \in \TT$.
>
> Therefore $\TT$ is a topology on $X$.
:::




We anticipated that topology is the extension of familiar concepts of open set, continuity, etc.
that we have in $\R^n$. Let us see how the usual definition of open set of $\R^n$ can fit
in our new abstract framework of topology. 



::: Definition
### Open set of $\R^n$

Let $A \subseteq \R^n$. We say that the set $A$ is **open** if it holds:
$$
\forall \, \xx \in A \,, \,\, \exists \, r > 0 \st B_r(\xx) \subseteq A \,,
$${#eq-open-set-Rn}
where $B_r(\xx)$ is the ball of radius $r>0$ centered at $\xx$
$$
B_r(\xx) := \{ \yy \in \R^n \divider \norm{ \yy - \xx } < r  \} \,, 
$$
and the **Euclidean norm** of $\xx \in \R^n$ is defined by 
$$
\| \xx \| := \sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^n  x_i^2 } \,.
$$

See @fig-open-set-Rn for a schematic picture of an open set.
:::

::: Definition
### Euclidean topology of $\R^n$  {#definition-euclidean-topology}

The Euclidean topology on $\R^n$ is the topology $\TT$ defined by
$$
\TT := \{ A \divider A \subseteq \R^n \,, \,\, A \, \mbox{ is open}  \} \,.
$$

:::


We need to check that the above definition is well-posed, in the sense that we have to
prove that $\TT$ is a topology on $\R^n$.


::: Proof
### Well-posedness of Definition \ref{definition-euclidean-topology}

Let us check that $\TT$ is a topology on $\R^n$: 

  - (A1) We have $\emptyset , \R^n \in \TT$: Indeed $\emptyset$ is open because there is no point $\xx$ for which (@eq-open-set-Rn) needs to be checked. Moreover $\R^n$ is open because (@eq-open-set-Rn) holds with any radius $r>0$. 
  - (A2) Let $A_i \in \TT$ for all $i \in I$ and define the union set
  $$
  A:=\bigcup_{i \in I} A_i \,.
  $$
  We need to check that $A$ is open. Let $\xx \in A$. By definition of union, there exists an index $i_0 \in I$ such that
  $\xx \in A_{i_0}$. Since $A_{i_0}$ is open, by (@eq-open-set-Rn) there exists $r>0$ such that 
  $B_r(\xx) \subseteq A_{i_0}$. As $A_{i_0} \subseteq A$, we conclude that $B_r(\xx) \subseteq A$. Thus $A$ is open and $A \in \TT$.

 - (A3) Let $A, B \in \TT$. 
  We need to check that $A \cap B$ is open. Let $\xx \in A \cap B$. Therefore $\xx \in A$ and $\xx \in B$. Since $A$ and $B$ are open, by (@eq-open-set-Rn) there exist $r_1,r_2>0$ such that 
  $B_{r_1}(\xx) \subseteq A$ and $B_{r_2}(\xx) \subseteq B$. Set $r := \min\{ r_1,r_2\}$. Then 
  $$
  B_r(\xx) \subseteq B_{r_1}(\xx) \subseteq A  \,, \quad 
  B_r(\xx) \subseteq B_{r_2}(\xx) \subseteq B  \,, 
  $$
  Hence $B_r(\xx) \subseteq A \cap B$, showing that $A \cap B$ open, so that $A \cap B \in \TT$.

 This proves that $\TT$ is a topology on $\R^n$.
:::



Let us make a basic bus useful observation: balls in $\R^n$ are open for the Euclidean topology.


::: {.Proposition   #proposition-balls-open}

Let $\R^n$ be equipped with $\TT$ the Euclidean topology. Let $r>0$ and $\xx \in \R^n$. Then
$$
B_r(\xx) \in \TT \,.
$$

:::


::: Proof

We need to shown that $B_r(\xx)$ satisfies (@eq-open-set-Rn). Therefore, let $\yy \in B_r(\xx)$. In particular
$$
\norm{\xx - \yy}<r \,.
$${#eq-balls-open}
Define 
$$
\e := r - \norm{\xx - \yy} \,.
$$
Note that $\e>0$ by (@eq-balls-open). We claim that 
$$
B_{\e} (\yy) \subseteq B_r (\xx) \,,
$${#eq-proof-ball-open}
see @fig-balls-open. Indeed, let $\zz \in B_{\e}(\yy)$. By triangle inequality we have
$$
\| \zz - \xx \| \leq \norm{ \xx - \yy } + \norm{ \yy - \zz } <  \norm{ \xx - \yy } + \e = r \,, 
$$
where we used that $\norm{\yy - \zz} < \e$ and the definition of $\e$. Hence $\zz \in B_r(\xx)$, proving 
(@eq-proof-ball-open). This proves that $B_r(\xx)$ satisfies (@eq-open-set-Rn), and is therefore
open.


:::

## Closed sets



The opposite of open sets are closed sets.


::: Definition 
### Closed set

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space. A set $C \subseteq X$ is **closed**
if 
$$
C^c   \in \TT \,, 
$$
where $C^c:= X \smallsetminus C$ is the complement of $C$ in $X$.
:::


In words, a set is closed if its complement is open. 


::: Warning

There are sets which are neither open nor closed. For example consider $\R$ equipped with Euclidean topology. Then the interval
$$
A:=[0,1) 
$$
is neither open nor closed.

> For the moment we do not have the tools to prove this. We will have them shortly. 

:::


We could have defined a topology starting from closed sets. We would
have had to replace the properties (A1)-(A2)-(A3) with suitable properties for closed sets. Such properties are detailed in the following proposition.


::: Proposition

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space. Properties (A1)-(A2)-(A3) of $\TT$ are equivalent to (C1)-(C2)-(C3), where

- (C1) $\emptyset, X$ are closed.
- (C2) If $C_i$ is closed for all $i \in I$, then
$$
\bigcap_{i \in I} \, C_i
$$
is closed.
- (C3) If $C_1,C_2$ are closed then
$$
C_1 \cup C_2
$$
is closed.

:::


::: Proof

We have 3 points to check:

- The equivalence between (A1) and (C1) is clear, since
$$
\emptyset^c = X \,, \quad X^c = \emptyset \,.
$$

- Suppose $C_i$ are closed for all $i \in I$. Therefore $C_i^c$ are open for all $i \in I$. By De Morgan's laws we have that
$$
\left(  \bigcap_{i \in I} \, C_i \right)^c =  \bigcup_{i \in I} \, C_i^c 
$$
showing that
$$
\bigcap_{i \in I} \, C_i  \, \mbox{ is closed} \quad 
\iff \quad 
\bigcup_{i \in I} \, C_i^c  \, \mbox{ is open} \,.
$$
Therefore (A2) and (C2) are equivalent.

- Suppose $C_1,C_2$ are closed. Therefore $C_1^c, C_2^c$ are open. By De Morgan's laws we have that
$$
\left(  C_1 \cup  C_2 \right)^c =  C_1^c \cap C_2^c 
$$
showing that
$$
C_1 \cup  C_2 \, \mbox{ is closed} \quad 
\iff \quad 
 C_1^c \cap C_2^c  \, \mbox{ is open} \,.
$$
Therefore (A3) and (C3) are equivalent.
:::

As a consequence of the above proposition, we can define a topology by declaring
what the closed sets are. We then need to verify that (C1)-(C2)-(C3) are 
satisfied by such topology. Let us make an example.

::: Example
### The Zariski topology

Let $(\mathbb{K}, + , \cdot)$ be a field. Define
$$
X:=\mathbb{K}^n := \{  (a_1, \ldots, a_n) \divider a_i \in \mathbb{K}  \} \,.
$$
Consider the set of polynomials with coefficients in the field 
$$
\mathbb{K}[x_1,\ldots,x_n] \,.
$$
Therefore $f \in \mathbb{K}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ has the form 
$$
f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = \lambda_1 x_1 + \ldots + \lambda_n x_n \,,
$$
where $\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n$ are given elements of $\mathbb{K}$.
For $I \subset \mathbb{K}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ define
$$
V(I):= \{  (a_1,\ldots,a_n) \in \mathbb{K}^n \divider 
f(a_1,\ldots,a_n) = 0 \,, \,\, \forall \, f \in I    \} \,.
$$
Define
$$
\mathcal{C} := \{ V(I) \divider I \subset \mathbb{K}[x_1,\ldots,x_n] \} \,.
$$
Then $\mathcal{C}$ satisfies (C1), (C2) and (C3). This is an easy check,
and is left as exercise. $\mathcal{C}$ is called the **Zariski Topology**
on the field $\mathbb{K}^n$. This is used in algebraic geometry to 
study Affine Varieties, an algebraic version of surfaces, see [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zariski_topology).

## Comparing topologies




Consider the situation where you have two topologies $\TT_1$ and $\TT_2$ on the same 
set $X$. We would like to have some notions of comparison between $\TT_1$ and $\TT_2$.


::: Definition
### Finer and coarser topology

Let $X$ be a set and let $\TT_1$, $\TT_2$ be topologies on $X$. Suppose that
$$
\TT_2 \subseteq \TT_1 \,.
$$
We say that:

- $\TT_1$ is **finer** than $\TT_2$.
- $\TT_2$ is **coarser** than $\TT_1$.

If it holds 
$$
\TT_2 \subsetneq \TT_1 \,,
$$
we say that:

- $\TT_1$ is **strictly finer** than $\TT_2$.
- $\TT_2$ is **strictly coarser** than $\TT_1$.

We say that $\TT_1$ and $\TT_2$ are the **same** topology if
$$
\TT_1 = \TT_2 \,.
$$
:::




::: Example

Let $X$ be a set and consider the trivial and discrete topologies
$$
\TT_{\textrm{trivial}} = \{ \emptyset, X\} \,, \quad \TT_{\textrm{discrete}} = \{ A \divider A \subseteq X \} \,.
$$
Then 
$$
\TT_{\textrm{trivial}} \subsetneq \TT_{\textrm{discrete}} \,,
$$
so that $\TT_{\textrm{discrete}}$ is strictly finer than $\TT_{\textrm{trivial}}$.


:::


Another interesting example is given by the **cofinite topology** on 
$\R$. The sets in this topology are open if they are either empty, or coincide with $\R$ with a finite number of points removed.


::: Example
### Cofinite topology on $\R$



Consider the following family $\TT_{\textrm{cofinite}}$ of subsets of $\R$
$$
\TT_{\textrm{cofinite}} := \{ U \subseteq \R \divider U^c \, \mbox{ is finite, }  \mbox{or } U^c = \R \}\,. 
$$
Then $(\R,\TT_{\textrm{cofinite}})$ is a topological space, and $\TT_{\textrm{cofinite}}$ is called the **cofinite topology**. We have that
$$
\TT_{\textrm{cofinite}} \subsetneq \TT_{\textrm{euclidean}} \,.
$$



> Exercise: Show that $\TT_{\textrm{cofinite}}$ is a topology on $\R$ and that $\TT_{\textrm{cofinite}} \subsetneq \TT_{\textrm{euclidean}}$.

:::





## Convergence

We have generalized the notion of open set to arbitrary sets. Next we generalize
the notion of convergence of sequences.

::: Definition
### Convergent sequence

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological. Consider a sequence $\{x_n\}_{n \in \N} \subseteq X$ and a point
$x \in X$. We say that $x_n$ converges to $x_0$ if the following property holds:
$$
\forall \, U \in \TT  \st x_0 \in U\,, \,\, \exists \, N = N(U) \in \N \st  x_n \in U \,, \, \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$ {#eq-convergence}

:::


::: Notation

The convergence of $x_n$ to $x_0$ is denoted by 
$$
x_n \to x_0 \quad \mbox{ or } \quad  \lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = x_0 \,.
$$

:::


Let us analyze the definition of convergence in the topologies we have encountered so far. We will have that:

- **Trivial topology**: Every sequence converges to every point.
- **Discrete topology**: A sequence converges if and only if it is eventually constant.
- **Euclidean topology**: Topological convergence coincides with classical notion of convergence.



We now precisely state and prove the above claims.

::: Proposition
### Convergence for trivial topology

Let $(X,\TT)$ be topological space, with $\TT$ the trivial topology, that is,
$$
\TT = \{ \emptyset, X \} \,.
$$
Let $\{x_n\} \subseteq X$ be a sequence and $x_0 \in X$ a point. Then 
$$
x_n \to x_0 \,.
$$

:::



::: Proof

To show that $x_n \to x_0$ we need to check that (@eq-convergence) holds. Therefore, let 
$U \in \TT$ with $x_0 \in U$. We have two cases:

- $U = \emptyset$:  This case is not possible, since $x_0$ cannot be in $U$. 

- $U = X$: Take $N=1$. Since $U$ is the whole space, then $x_n \in U$ for all $n \geq 1$.  

As these are all the open sets, we conclude that $x_n \to x_0$.
:::



::: Warning

This example is saying that in general the topological limit of a sequence is **not unique**!

:::



::: Proposition
### Convergence for discrete topology

Let $(X,\TT)$ be topological space, with $\TT$ the discrete topology, that is,
$$
\TT = \{ A  \divider A \subseteq X \} \,.
$$
Let $\{x_n\} \subseteq X$ be a sequence and $x_0 \in X$ a point. They are equivalent:

1. $x_n \to x_0$.
2. $\{x_n\}$ is eventually constant, that is, there exists $N \in \N$ such that 
$$
x_n = x_0 \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
:::



::: Proof

*Part 1. Assume that $x_n \to x_0$.*

We have to prove that $\{x_n\}$ is eventually constant. To this end, let 
$$
U = \{x_0\} \,.
$$
Then $U \in \TT$. Since $x_n \to x_0$, by (@eq-convergence) there exists $N \in \N$ such that
$$
x_n \in U  \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
As $U = \{x_0\}$, the above is saying that $x_n = x_0$ for all $n \geq N$. Hence $x_n$ is eventually constant. 


*Part 2. Assume that $x_n$ is eventually equal to $x_0$.*

By assumption there exists $N \in \N$ such that 
$$
x_n = x_0 \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$${#eq-convergence-discrete}
Let $U \in \TT$ be an open set such that $x_0 \in U$. By (@eq-convergence-discrete) we have
that 
$$
x_n \in U \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
Since $U$ was arbitrary, we conclude that $x_n \to x_0$.
:::


Before proceeding to examining convergence in the Euclidean topology, let us recall the 
classical definition of convergence in $\R^n$.

::: Definition
### Classical convergence in $\R^n$

Let $\{\xx_n\} \subseteq \R^n$ and $\xx_0 \in \R^n$. We say that $\xx_n$ converges $\xx_0$ in the 
classical sense if 
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \norm{\xx_n - \xx_0}  = 0 \,. 
$$
The above is equivalent to: For all $\e>0$ there exists $N \in \N$ such that
$$
\norm{\xx_n - \xx_0} < \e  \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$


:::


::: Proposition
### Convergence for Euclidean topology  {#proposition-convergence-Rn}

Let $\R^n$ be equipped with $\TT$ the Euclidean topology.
Let $\{\xx_n\} \subseteq \R^n$ be a sequence and $\xx_0 \in \R^n$ a point. They are equivalent:

1. $\xx_n \to \xx_0$ with respect to $\TT$.
2. $\xx_n \to \xx_0$ in the classical sense.
:::


::: Proof

*Part 1. Assume $\xx_n \to \xx_0$ with respect to $\TT$.*

Fix $\e>0$ and consider the set
$$
U := B_{\e}(\xx_0) \,.
$$
By Proposition \ref{proposition-balls-open} we know that $U \in \TT$. Moreover $\xx_0 \in U$.
By the convergence $\xx_n \to \xx_0$ with respect to $\TT$, there exists $N \in \N$ such that 
$$
\xx_n \in U \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
As $U = B_{\e}(\xx_0)$, the above reads
$$
\norm{\xx_n - \xx_0} < \e \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,,
$$
showing that $\xx_n \to \xx_0$ in the classical sense.


*Part 2. Assume $\xx_n \to \xx_0$ in the classical sense.*


Let $U \in \TT$ be such that $\xx_0 \in U$. By definition of Euclidean topology, this means that 
there exists $r>0$ such that 
$$
B_r(\xx_0) \subseteq U \,.
$$
As $\xx_n \to \xx_0$ in the classical sense, there exists $N \in \N$ such that 
$$
\norm{\xx_n - \xx_0} < r \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
The above is equivalent to 
$$
\xx_n \in B_{r}(\xx_0) \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
Since $B_r(\xx_0) \subseteq U$, we have proven that
$$
\xx_n \in U \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
Since $U$ is arbitrary, we conclude that $\xx_n \to \xx_0$ with respect to $\TT$.
:::


::: Notation

Since classical convergence in $\R^n$ agrees with topological convergence with respect to $\TT$, we will just say that $\xx_n \to \xx_0$ in $\R^n$ without ambiguity.

:::




We conclude with a useful proposition which relates convergences 
when multiple topologies are present.


::: Proposition

Let $X$ be a set and $\TT_1,\TT_2$ be topologies on $X$. Suppose that
$$
\TT_2 \subseteq \TT_1 \,.
$$
Let $\{x_n\} \subset X$ and $x_0 \in X$. We have
$$
x_n \to x_0 \,\, \mbox{ in } \,\, \TT_1  \quad \implies
\quad 
x_n \to x_0 \,\, \mbox{ in } \,\, \TT_2 \,.
$$

:::


::: Proof
Assume $x_n \to x_0$ in $\TT_1$. We need to prove that $x_n \to x_0$ in $\TT_2$. Therefore, let $U \in \TT_2$ be such that $x_0 \in U$. Since $\TT_2 \subseteq \TT_1$, we have that $U \in \TT_1$. As  $x_n \to x_0$ in $\TT_1$, there exists $N \in \N$ such that 
$$
x_n \in U \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
Since $U \in \TT_2$, the above proves $x_n \to x_0$ in $\TT_2$.


:::






## Metric spaces


We will now define a class of topological spaces known as metric spaces.




::: Definition 
### Distance

Let $X$ be a set. A **distance** on $X$ is a function 
$$
d \colon X \times X \to \R
$$
such that, for all $x,y,z \in X$ they hold:

- (M1) Positivity: The distance is non-negative
$$
d(x,y) \geq 0 \,.
$$ 
Moreover 
$$
d(x,y) = 0 \quad \iff x=y \,.
$$

- (M2) Symmetry: The distance is symmetric
$$
d(x,y) = d(y,x) \,.
$$

- (M3) Triangle Inequality: It holds
$$
d(x,z) \leq d(x,y) + d(y,z) \,.
$$
:::




::: Definition
### Metric space

Let $X$ be a set and $d \colon X \times X \to \R$ be a distance on $X$. 
We say that the pair $(X,d)$ is a **metric space**.
:::




::: Example
### $\R^n$ as metric space

The Euclidean norm naturally induces a distance over $\R^n$ by setting
$$
d(\xx,\yy) := \norm{ \xx - \yy } \,.
$$
Then $(\R^n,d)$ is a metric space.

> It is trivial to check that the Euclidean distance satisfies (M1) and (M2). 
> To show (M3), recalling the triangle inequality in $\R^n$:
$$
\| \xx + \yy \| \leq \| \xx \|   + \| \yy \| \,,
$$
for all $\xx , \yy \in \R^n$. Using the above we obtain
\begin{align*}
d(\xx,\yy) & = \| \xx - \yy \| \\
             & = \| (\xx - \zz) + (\zz - \yy) \| \\
             & \leq  \| \xx - \zz \| + \| \zz - \yy \|  \\
             & = d (\xx,\zz) + d (\zz,\yy) \,,
\end{align*}
proving that $d$ satisfies (M3). This prove that $(\R^n,d)$ is a metric space.

:::



::: Example
### $p$-distance on $\R^n$


For $\xx,\yy \in \R^n$ and $p \in [1,\infty)$ define 
$$
d_p ( \xx, \yy ) := \left(  \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - y_i|^p   \right)^{\frac1p} \,.
$$
Note that $d_2$ coincides with the Euclidean distance.
For $p = \infty$ we set
$$
d_{\infty} ( \xx, \yy ) := \max_{i = 1 \ldots, n} |x_i - y_i|  \,.
$$
We have that $(\R^n,d_p)$ is a metric space. 

> Indeed properties (M1)-(M2) hold trivially. The triangle inequality is also 
> trivially satisfied by $d_{\infty}$. We are left with checking the triangle inequality
> for $d_p$ with $p \geq 1$. To this end, define
$$
\| \xx \|_p :=  \left(  \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i|^p  \right)^{\frac1p} \,.
$$
Minkowski's inequality, see [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_inequality), states that 
$$
\| \xx + \yy \|_p \leq   \| \xx  \|_p  +  \|  \yy \|_p \,,
$$
for all $\xx ,\yy \in \R^n$. Therefore
\begin{align*}
d_p(\xx,\yy) & = \| \xx - \yy \|_p  \\
             & = \| (\xx - \zz) + (\zz - \yy) \|_p \\
             & \leq  \| \xx - \zz \|_p + \| \zz - \yy \|_p  \\
             & = d_p (\xx,\zz) + d_p (\zz,\yy) \,,
\end{align*}
proving that $d_p$ satisfies (M3). Hence $(\R^n,d_p)$ is a metric space.
:::




A metric $d$ on a set $X$ naturally induces a topology which is **compatible** with the metric.

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. We define the topology $\TT_d$ **induced by the metric** $d$ as the
collection of sets $U \subseteq X$ that satisfy the following property:
$$
\forall \, x \in U \,, \, \exists \, r \in \R, \, r > 0 \, \st \, B_r(x) \subseteq U \,,
$$
where $B_r(x)$ is the ball centered at $x$ of radius $r$. This is defined by 
$$
B_r(x) := \{ y \in X  \, \colon \,  d(x,y)<r  \} \,.
$$


:::


We need to check that the above definition is well-posed, that is, we need to show 
that $\TT_d$ is actually a topology on $X$. The proof follows, line by line, the proof that the Euclidean topology is indeed a topology, see proof immediately below Definition \ref{definition-euclidean-topology}. This is left
as an exercise.











::: Example
### Topology induced by Euclidean distance

Consider the metric space $(\R^n,d)$ with $d$ the Euclidean distance. Then 
$$
\TT_d = \TT_{\textrm{euclidean}} \,,
$$
where $\TT_{\textrm{euclidean}}$ is the Euclidean topology on $\R^n$. 

> Exercise: Prove the above statement. It is an immediate consequence of definitions.
:::



::: Example
### Discrete distance

Let $X$ be a set. Define the function $d \colon X \times X \to \R$ by
$$
d(x,y) := 
\begin{cases}
	0 & \mbox{ if } \, x = y \\
	1 & \mbox{ if } \, x \neq y 
\end{cases}
$$
Then $(X,d)$ is a metric space, and $d$ is called the **discrete distance**. Moreover 
$$
\TT_d = \TT_{\textrm{discrete}}
$$
where $\TT_{\textrm{discrete}}$ is the **discrete topology** on $X$.


> Exercise: Prove that $(X,d)$ is a metric space and $\TT_d = \TT_{\textrm{discrete}}$.

The following proposition tells us that balls in a metric space $X$
are open sets. Moreover balls are the building blocks of all 
open sets in $X$. The proof is left as an exercise.


::: {.Proposition #proposition-metric-ball}


Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space and $\TT_d$ the topology induced by $d$. Then:

- For all $x \in X$, $r>0$ we have $B_r(x) \subseteq \TT_d$.
- $U \in \TT_d$ if and only if
$$
U = \bigcup_{ i \in I } B_{r_i}(x_i) \,,
$$
with $I$ family of indices and $x_i \in X$, $r_i > 0$.

:::



We now define the concept of equivalent metrics.


::: Definition
### Equivalent metrics

Let $X$ be a set and $d_1,d_2$ be metrics on $X$. We say that $d_1$ and $d_2$ are
equivalent if
$$
\TT_{d_1} = \TT_{d_2} \,.
$$

:::


The following proposition gives a sufficent condition for the equivalence of two metrics.


::: {.Proposition  #proposition-equivalent-metrics}


Let $X$ be a set and $d_1,d_2$ be metrics on $X$. Suppose that 
there exists a constant $\alpha > 0$ such that
$$
\frac{1}{\alpha} \, d_2 (x,y) \leq d_1 (x,y) \leq \alpha \, d_2(x,y) \,, \quad \forall \, x,y \in X \,.
$$
Then $d_1$ and $d_2$ are equivalent metrics.

:::


The proof of Proposition \ref{proposition-equivalent-metrics} is trivial, and is left as an exercise.




::: Example

Let $p > 1$. The metrics $d_p$ and $d_{\infty}$ on $\R^n$ are equivalent.

> This follows from Proposition \ref{proposition-equivalent-metrics} and the estimate
$$
d_{\infty} (\xx,\yy) \leq d_p (\xx,\yy) \leq n \, d_{\infty} (\xx,\yy) \,, \quad \forall \xx \,, \, \yy \in \R^n \,.
$$
:::




::: Warning

If two metrics are equivalent, that does not mean they have the same balls. For example the balls of the metrics $d_1$, $d_2$ and $d_{\infty}$ on $\R^n$ look very different, see @fig-balls-R2.

:::

We can characterize the convergence of sequences in metric spaces.


::: Proposition
### Convergence in metric space

Suppose $(X,d)$ is a metric space and denote by $\TT_d$ the topology induce by $d$. Let $\{x_n\} \subseteq X$ and $x_0 \in X$. They are equivalent:

1. $x_n \to x_0$ with respect to the topology $\TT_d$.
2. $d(x_n,x_0) \to 0$ in $\R$.
3. For all $\e>0$ there exists $N \in \N$ such that 
$$
x_n \in B_r(x_0) \, , \,\, \forall \, n \geq \N \,.
$$

:::

The proof is similar to the one of Proposition \ref{proposition-convergence-Rn}, and it is left as an exercise.






## Interior, closure and boundary


We now define interior, closure and boundary of a set $A$ contained 
in a topological space.


::: Definition
### Interior of a set

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space and $A \subseteq X$ a set.
The **interior** of $A$ is the set
$$
\interior{A} :=  \bigcup_{ \substack{U \subseteq A \\ U \in \TT} } \, U \,.
$$

:::


::: Remark

The definition of $\interior{A}$ is well-posed, since $\emptyset \subseteq A$ and $\emptyset \in \TT$. Therefore the union is taken over a non-empty family.

:::



::: Proposition

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space and $A \subseteq X$ a set. Then
$\interior{A}$ is the largest open set contained in $A$, that is:

1. $\interior{A}$ is open.
2. $\interior{A} \subseteq A$.
3. If $V \in \TT$ and $V \subseteq A$, then $V \subseteq \interior{A}$.
4. $A$ is open if and only if 
$$
A = \interior{A} \,.
$$

:::



::: Proof

We have:

1. $\interior{A}$ is open, since it is union of open sets, see property (A2).
2. $\interior{A} \subseteq A$, since $\interior{A}$ is union of sets contained in $A$.

3. Suppose $V \in \TT$ and $V \subseteq A$. Therefore 
$$
V \subseteq   \bigcup_{ \substack{U \subseteq A \\ U \in \TT} } \, U = \interior{A} \,.
$$

4. Suppose that $A$ is open. Then
$$
A \subseteq \bigcup_{ \substack{U \subseteq A \\ U \in \TT}  } \, U  = \interior{A}  \,.
$$
As we already know that $\interior{A} \subseteq A$, we conclude that $A = \interior{A}$.  
    Conversely, suppose that $A = \interior{A}$. Since $\interior{A}$ is open, then also $A$ is open.
:::




::: Definition
### Closure of a set

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space and $A \subseteq X$ a set.
The **closure** of $A$ is the set
$$
\closure{A} :=  \bigcap_{ \substack{A \subseteq C \\ C \, \text{closed} } } \, C \,,
$$
that is, $\closure{A}$ is the intersection of all closed sets containing 
$A$.

:::



::: Remark

The definition of $\closure{A}$ is well-posed, since $A \subseteq X$, and $X$ is closed. Therefore the intersection is taken over a non-empty family.

:::



::: Proposition

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space and $A \subseteq X$ a set. Then
$\closure{A}$ is the smallest closed set containing $A$, that is:

1. $\closure{A}$ is closed.
2. $A \subseteq \closure{A}$.
3. If $V$ is closed $A \subseteq V$, then $\closure{A} \subseteq V$.
4. $A$ is closed if and only if 
$$
A = \closure{A} \,.
$$

:::


::: Proof

We have:

1. $\closure{A}$ is closed, since it is intersection of closed sets, see property (C2).

2. $A \subseteq \closure{A}$, since $\closure{A}$ is intersection of sets which contain $A$.

3. Suppose $V$ is closed and $A \subseteq V$. Therefore 
$$
\closure{A} =  \bigcap_{ \substack{A \subseteq C \\ C \, \text{closed}  } } \, C  \subseteq V \,.
$$

4. Suppose that $A$ is closed. Then
$$
\closure{A} =  \bigcap_{ \substack{A \subseteq C \\ C \, \text{closed}} } \, C  \subseteq A \,,
$$
showing that $\closure{A} \subseteq A$. As we already know that $A \subseteq \closure{A}$, we conclude that $A = \closure{A}$.   
  Conversely, suppose that $A = \closure{A}$. Since $\closure{A}$ is closed, then also $A$ is closed.
:::


::: {.Lemma #lemma-closure-intersection}

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space and $A \subseteq X$ a set. They are equivalent:

1. $x_0 \in \closure{A}$.
2. For every $U \in \TT$ such that $x_0 \in U$, it holds
$$
U \cap A \neq \emptyset  \,.
$$

:::



::: Proof

We prove the contronominal statement:
$$
x_0 \notin \closure{A} \quad \iff \quad 
\exists \,\, U \in \TT \st x_0 \in U \,, \,\, \, U \cap A = \emptyset \,.
$$

Let us check the two implications hold:

- Suppose $x_0 \notin \closure{A}$. Then $x_0 \in U := (\closure{A})^c$. Note that $U$ is open,
since $U^c = \closure{A}$ is closed. We have
$$
A \cap U = A \cap (\overline{A})^c = \emptyset \,,
$$
since $A \subseteq \closure{A}$.

- Assume there exists $U \in \TT$ such that $x_0 \in U$ and $U \cap A = \emptyset$. Therefore
$A \subseteq U^c$. Since $U$ is open, $U^c$ is closed. Then
$$
\closure{A} = \bigcap_{ \substack{  A \subseteq C    \\ C \, \text{closed}  }   } \, C \subseteq U^c \,. 
$$
Since $x_0 \notin U^c$, we conclude that $x_0 \notin \closure{A}$.

:::




::: Definition
### Boundary of a set

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space and $A \subseteq X$ a set. 
The **boundary** of $A$ is the set
$$
\partial A := \closure{A} \smallsetminus \interior{A} \,.
$$

:::


::: Proposition

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space and $A \subseteq X$ a set. Then
$\partial A$ is closed.

:::


::: Proof 

We can write
$$
\partial A =  \closure{A} \smallsetminus \interior{A} = \closure{A} \cap (\interior{A})^c \,.
$$
Note that $\closure{A}$ is closed and $(\interior{A})^c$ is closed, 
since $\interior{A}$ is open. Then $\partial A$ is intersection
of two closed sets, and in hence closed by (C2).

:::




We can characterize $\closure{A}$ as the set of limit points of sequences in $A$.


::: Definition

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space and $A \subseteq X$. The set of
limit points of $A$ is defined as
$$
L(A):=\{  x \in X \divider \exists \, \{x_n \} \subseteq A \st x_n \to x    \} \,.
$$

:::


::: {.Proposition #proposition-closure-sequence}


Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space and $A \subseteq X$ a set. 
Let $\{x_n\} \subseteq A$ and $x_0 \in X$ be such that $x_n \to x_0$. Then
$x_0 \in \closure{A}$. Therefore 
$$
L(A) \subseteq \closure{A} \,.
$$

:::


::: Proof

Suppose by contradiction $x_0 \notin \closure{A}$, so that
$$
x_0 \in (\closure{A})^c \,.
$$
Since $(\closure{A})^c$ is open and $x_n \to x_0$, there exists $N \in \N$
such that 
$$
x_n \in (\closure{A})^c \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
This is a contradiction, since we were assuming that $\{x_n\} \subseteq A$. This shows $x_0 \in \closure{A}$ and therefore
$L(A) \subseteq \closure{A}$.


:::



::: Warning

The converse of Proposition \ref{proposition-closure-sequence} is false
in general, that is, 
$$
\closure{A} \not\subset L(A) \,.
$$
We show a counterexample of the above in Example \ref{example-closure-counter}.
The above relation holds in the so-called first countable topological spaces,
such as metric spaces, see Proposition \ref{proposition-closure-metric} below.
:::


::: {.Example #example-closure-counter}
### Co-countable topology

Let $X=\R$ with the co-countable topology 
$$
\TT := \{ A \subseteq \R \divider A^c = \R \,\, \mbox{ or } \,\, A^c \,
\mbox{ countable }\} \,.
$$
The set 
$$
A = (-\infty,0]
$$
is not closed and $\closure{A} = \R$. Moreover, convergent sequences in $(X,\TT)$ are eventually constant. Therefore $L(A) = A$,
showing that $\closure{A} \not\subset L(A)$.

> Exercise: Prove all the above statements.
:::




In metric spaces we can characterize the interior of a set and the closure in the following way.


::: {.Proposition #proposition-closure-metric}


Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. Denote by $\TT_d$ the topology induced by $d$.
Let $A \subseteq X$. We have
$$
\interior{A} = \{ x \in A \divider \exists \,\, r>0  \st B_r(x) \subseteq A   \} \,.
$${#eq-formula-interior}
and 
$$
\closure{A} = L(A):= \{  x \in X \st \exists \,\, \{ x_n \} \subseteq A \st x_n \to x   \} \,.
$${#eq-formula-closure}


:::


 

::: Proof
The proof of (@eq-formula-interior) is left as an exercise. Let us prove 
(@eq-formula-closure). The inclusion $L(A) \subseteq \closure{A}$ holds by Proposition \ref{proposition-closure-sequence}. We are left to show that
$$
\closure{A} \subseteq L(A) \,.
$$
To this end, let $x_0 \in \closure{A}$. For $n \in \N$, consider the ball $B_{1/n}(x_0)$. Since
$B_{1/n}(x_0) \in \TT_d$ and $x_0 \in B_{\e}(x_0)$, we can apply Lemma \ref{lemma-closure-intersection} and deduce that
$$
B_{1/n}(x_0) \cap A \neq \emptyset \,.
$$
Let $x_n \in B_{1/n}(x_0) \cap A$. Since $n$ was arbitrary, we have constructed a sequence
$\{x_n\} \subseteq A$ such that 
$$
x_n \in B_{1/n}(x_0) \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
In particular, we have that 
$$
d(x_n,x_0) < \frac{1}{n} \to 0
$$
as $n \to \infty$. Thus $x_n \to x_0$, showning that $x_0 \in L(A)$.
:::





::: Example

Consider $\R$ with the Euclidean topology and $A :=[0,1)$. We have that 
$$
\interior{A} = (0,1) \,, \quad \closure{A} = [0,1] \,, \quad \partial A = \{0,1\} \,.
$$
In particular 
$$
\interior{A}  \neq A \,, \quad \closure{A} \neq A \,,
$$
showing that $A$ is neither open, nor closed. 

> The proof of the above statements is left as an exercise.

## Density



::: Definition
### Density

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space and $A \subseteq X$ a set. We say that $A$ is **dense** in $X$ if 
$$
A \cap U \neq \emptyset \,, \quad \, \forall \,\, U \in \TT\,, \,\, U \neq \emptyset \,.
$$

:::



Density can be characterized in terms of closure.



::: Proposition

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space and $A \subseteq X$ a set. They are equivalent:

1. $A$ is **dense** in $X$.
2. It holds
$$
\closure{A} = X \,.
$$

:::



::: Proof

*Part 1.* Let $A$ be dense in $X$. Suppose by contradiction that
$$
\closure{A} \neq X \,.
$$
This means $(\closure{A})^c \neq \emptyset$.
Note that $(\closure{A})^c$ is open, being $\closure{A}$ closed.
By density of $A$ in $X$ we have
$$
A \cap (\closure{A})^c \neq \emptyset \,.
$$
Since $A \subseteq \closure{A}$, the above is a contradiction.


*Part 2.* Suppose that $\closure{A} = X$. Let $U \in \TT$ with $U \neq \emptyset$. By contradiction, assume that
$$
A \cap U = \emptyset \,.
$$
Therefore $A \subseteq U^c$. As $U^c$ is closed, we have
$$
\closure{A} \subseteq U^c\,, 
$$
because $\closure{A}$ is the smallest closed set containing $A$. 
Recalling that $\closure{A} = X$, we conclude that $U^c = X$. 
Therefore $U = \emptyset$, which is a contradiction.

:::




::: Example

Consider $\R$ with the Euclidean topology.

1. We have that the set of integers $\Z$ is closed in $\R$. Indeed,
$$
\Z^c = \bigcup_{ z \in \Z}  \, (z , z + 1 ) \,. 
$$
Since $(z,z+1)$ is open in $\R$, by (A2) we conclude that 
$\Z^c$ is open, so that $\Z$ is closed. Therefore 
$$
\closure{\Z} = \Z \,,
$$
showing that $\Z$ is not dense in $\R$.


2. The rational numbers $\Q$ are instead dense in $\R$, as proven in the
Analysis module. Therefore 
$$
\closure{\Q} = \R \,.
$$
It is also easy to check that
$$
\interior{\Q} = \emptyset \,.
$$
Therefore 
$$
\interior{\Q} \neq \Q \,, \quad \closure{\Q} \neq \Q \,,
$$
showing that $\Q$ is neither open, nor closed. 

:::



::: Example


Consider $\R$ with the cofinite topology
$$
\TT_{\textrm{cofinite}} := \{ U \subset \R \divider U^c \, \mbox{ is finite, }  \mbox{ or } U^c = \R \}\,. 
$$
We have that 
$$
\closure{\Z } = \R \,,
$$
showing that $\Z$ is dense in $\R$.

> Proof. Suppose $C$ is a closed set such that $\Z \subseteq C$. By definition of $\TT_{\textrm{cofinite}}$ we have $C = \R$ or $C$ finite.
Since $\Z \subseteq C$ and $\Z$ is not finite, we conclude $C = \R$. This
proves that $\R$ is the only closed set containing $\Z$, and so $\closure{\Z} = \R$.

:::







## Hausdorff spaces



Hausdorff space are topological spaces in which points can be separated by
means of disjoint open sets.


::: Definition

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space. We say that $X$ is a Hausdorff space if for every two points $x,y \in X$ with $x \neq y$ there exist $U,V \in \TT$ such that
$$
x \in U \,, \quad y \in V \,, \quad U \cap V = \emptyset \,.
$$

:::



The main example of Hausdorff spaces are metrizable spaces.


::: {.Proposition  #proposition-hausdorff-1}

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space with $\TT_d$ the topology induced by $d$. Then $(X, \TT_d)$ is a Hausdorff space.

:::


::: Proof

Let $x,y \in X$ with $x \neq y$. Set 
$$
\e := \frac12 \, d(x,y) \,, 
$$
and define 
$$
U := B_{\e}(x)\,, \quad 
V := B_{\e}(y) \,.
$$
By Proposition \ref{proposition-metric-ball} we know that $U, V \in \TT_d$. Moreover $x \in U$, $y \in V$. We are left to show that 
$$
U \cap V = \emptyset \,.
$$
Suppose by contradiction that $U \cap V \neq \emptyset$ and let $z \in U \cap V$. Therefore 
$$
d(x,z) < \e \,,  \quad d(y,z) < \e \,.
$$
By triangle inequality we have
$$
d(x,y) \leq d(x,z) +  d(y,z) < \e + \e = d(x,y) \,,
$$
where in the last inequality we used the definition of $\e$. This is 
a contradiction. Therefore $U \cap V = \emptyset$ and $(X,\TT_d)$ is Hausdorff.


:::


In general, every metrizable space is Hausdorff.


::: Definition
### Metrizable space

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space. We say that the topology $\TT$ is metrizable if there
exists a metric $d$ on $X$ such that
$$
\TT = \TT_d \,,
$$
with $\TT_d$ the topology induced by $d$.

:::


::: {.Corollary #corollary-hausdorff}

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a metrizable space. Then $X$ is Hausforff.

:::


::: Proof

Since $(X,\TT)$ is metrizable, there exists a metric $d$ on $X$ such that 
$$
\TT  = \TT_d \,.
$$
By Proposition \ref{proposition-hausdorff-1} we know that $(X,\TT_d)$ is Hausdorff. Hence $(X,\TT)$ is Hausdorff.

:::



As a conseuqence of Corollary \ref{corollary-hausdorff} we have that
spaces which are not metrizable are not Hausdorff. Let us make 
a few examples.


::: Example
### Trivial topology is not Hausdorff

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space with $\TT$ trivial topology. Assume that $X$ has more than one element. Then $X$ is not Hausdorff.

> Indeed, let $x,y \in X$ with $x \neq y$. Suppose by contradiction that $X$ is Hausdorff. Then there exist $U,V \in \TT$ such that 
$$
x \in U \,, \quad y \in V \,, \quad U \cap V = \emptyset \,.
$$
Recall that
$$
\TT = \{  \emptyset, X \} \,.
$$
Since $x \in U$ and $y \in V$, we deduce that $U$ and $V$ are non-empty. 
Since $U$ and $V$ are open, the only possibility is that 
$$
U = V = X \,.
$$
In this case we have
$$
U \cap V = X \cap X = X \neq \emptyset \,,
$$
leading to a contradiciton. Hence $X$ is not Hausdorff.


:::




::: Example
### Cofinite topology on $\R$

$$
\TT := \{ U \subseteq \R \divider U^c \, \mbox{ is finite, }  \mbox{or } U^c = \R \}\,.

x_0 \in U \,, \quad y_0 \in V \,, \quad U \cap V = \emptyset \,.
$$
As $x_n \to x_0$ and $U \in \TT$ with $x_0 \in U$, there exists
$N_1 \in \N$ such that
$$
x_n \in U \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N_1  \,.
$$
Similarly, since $x_n \to y_0$ and $V \in \TT$ with $y_0 \in U$, there exists
$N_2 \in \N$ such that
$$
x_n \in V \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N_2  \,.
$$
Take $N:=\max\{N_1,N_2\}$. Then 
$$
x_n \in U \cap V \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N  \,.
$$
Since $U \cap V = \emptyset$, the above is a contradiction. Therefore the limit of $x_n$ is unique.

## Continuity

We extend the notion of continuity to topological spaces. To this end, 
we need the concept of pre-image of a set under a function.

::: Definition
### Images and Pre-images

Let $X, Y$ be sets and $f \colon X \to Y$ be a function. 

- Let $U \subseteq X$. The image of $U$ under $f$ is the subset of $Y$ defined by
$$
f (U) := \{ y \in Y \divider \exists \, x \in X \st y = f(x) \} = \{ f(x) \divider x \in X \} \,.
$$

- Let $V \subseteq Y$. The pre-image of $V$ under $f$ is the subset of $X$ defined by
$$
f^{-1} (V) := \{ x \in X \divider f(x) \in V \} \,.
$$

:::


::: Warning

The notation $f^{-1}(V)$ does not mean that we are inverting $f$. In fact, the pre-image is defined for all functions.

:::


Let us gather useful properties of images and pre-images.


::: Proposition

Let $X,Y$ be sets and $f \colon X \to Y$. We denote with the letter $A$ sets in $X$ and with the letter $B$ sets in $Y$. We have

- $A \subseteq f^{-1}(f(A))$
- $A = f^{-1}(f(A))$ if $f$ is injective
- $f(f^{-1}(B)) \subseteq B$
- $f(f^{-1}(B)) = B$ if $f$ is surjective
- If $A_1 \subseteq A_2$ then $f(A_1) \subseteq f(A_2)$
- If $B_1 \subseteq B_2$ then $f^{-1}(B_1) \subseteq f^{-1}(B_2)$
- If $A_i \subseteq X$ for $i \in I$ we have
\begin{gather*}
f \left(  \bigcup_{i \in I} A_i \right)  = \bigcup_{i \in I} f(A_i) \\
f \left(  \bigcap_{i \in I} A_i \right)  \subseteq \bigcap_{i \in I} f(A_i) 
\end{gather*}
- If $B_i \subseteq Y$ for $i \in I$ we have
\begin{gather*}
f^{-1} \left(  \bigcup_{i \in I} B_i \right)  = \bigcup_{i \in I} f^{-1}(B_i) \\
f^{-1} \left(  \bigcap_{i \in I} B_i \right)  = \bigcap_{i \in I} f^{-1}(B_i) 
\end{gather*}

Suppose $Z$ is another set and $g \colon Y \to Z$. Let $C \subseteq Z$. Then
\begin{align*}
& (g \circ f)(A)  = g(f(A)) \\
& (g \circ f)^{-1}(C)  = f^{-1}(g^{-1}(C)) 
\end{align*}

:::

It is a good exercise to try and prove a few of the above properties.
We omit the proof. We can now define continuous functions between topological spaces.

::: Definition
### Continuous function

Let $(X,\TT_X)$ and $(Y,\TT_Y)$ be topological spaces. Let $f \colon X \to Y$ be a function. 

- Let $x_0 \in X$. We say that $f$ is continuous at $x_0$ if it holds:
$$
\forall \, V \in \TT_Y \st f(x_0) \in V \,, \,\, \exists \, U \in \TT_X \st x_0 \in U \,, \,\, f(U) \subseteq V \,.
$$

- We say that $f$ is continuous from $(X,\TT_X)$ to $(Y,\TT_Y)$ if $f$ is continuous at each point $x_0 \in X$.

:::



The following proposition presents a useful characterization of continuous functions in terms of pre-images. 


::: {.Proposition  #proposition-continuity-characterization}

Let $(X,\TT_X)$ and $(Y,\TT_Y)$ be topological spaces. Let $f \colon X \to Y$ be a function. They are equivalent:

1. $f$ is continuous from $(X,\TT_X)$ to $(Y,\TT_Y)$.
2. It holds:
$$
f^{-1}(V) \in \TT_X  \,, \quad \forall \, V \in \TT_Y \,. 
$$

:::

::: Important

In other words, a function $f \colon X \to Y$ is continuous if and only if the pre-image of open sets in $Y$ are open sets in $X$. 

:::

The proof of Proposition \ref{proposition-continuity-characterization} is simple, but very tedious. We choose to skip it.



::: Example

Let $X$ be a set and $\TT_1$, $\TT_2$ be topologies on $X$. Define the identity map
$$
{\id}_{X} \colon (X,\TT_1) \to (X,\TT_2)  \,, \quad {\id}_{X} (x):= x \,.
$$
They are equivalent:

1. ${\id}_{X}$ is continuous from $(X,\TT_1)$ to $(X,\TT_2)$.
2. $\TT_1$ is finer than $\TT_2$
$$
\TT_2 \subseteq \TT_1 \,.
$$


>  Indeed, ${\id}_{X}$ is continuous if and only if
>  $$
>  {\id}_{X}^{-1} (V) \in \TT_1  \,, \quad \forall \, V \in \TT_2 \,.
>  $$
>  But ${\id}_{X}^{-1} (V) = V$, so that the above reads
>  $$
>  V \in \TT_1  \,, \quad \forall \, V \in \TT_2 \,,

Let us compare our new definition of contiuity with the classical notion of continuity in $\R^n$. Let us recall the definition of continuous function in $\R^n$.

::: Definition
### Continuity in the classical sense

Let $f \colon \subseteq \R^n \to \R^m$. We say that $f$ is continuous at $\xx_0$ if it holds:
$$
\forall \, \e > 0 \,, \, \exists \, \delta >0 \st \|f(\xx) - f(\xx_0)\|< \e \,\, \mbox{ if } \,\, \| \xx - \xx_0 \| < \delta \,.   
$$

:::


::: Proposition

Let $f \colon  \R^n \to \R^m$ and suppose $\R^n,\R^m$ are 
equipped with the Euclidean topology. Let $\xx_0 \in \R^n$. They are equivalent:

1. $f$ is continuous at $\xx_0$ in the topological sense.
2. $f$ is continuous at $\xx_0$ in the classical sense.

:::


::: Proof

*Part 1.* Suppose that $f$ is continuous at $\xx_0$ in the topological sense. Let $\e>0$ and consider the set 
$$
V := B_{\e}(f(\xx_0))\,.
$$
We have that $V \subset \R^m$ is open and $f(\xx_0) \in V$. As $f$ is 
continuous in the topological sense, there exists $U \subset \R^n$ open with $\xx_0 \in U$ and such that 
$$
f(U) \subset V = B_{\e}(f(\xx_0)) \,.
$${#eq-proof-continuity-3}
Since $U$ is open and $\xx_0 \in U$, there exists $\delta>0$ such that
$$
B_{\delta}(\xx_0) \subset U \,.
$$
By the above inclusion and (@eq-proof-continuity-3) we conclude that
$$
f(B_{\delta}(\xx_0)) \subset f(U) \subset V = B_{\e}(f(\xx_0)) \,.
$$
This is equivalent to 
$$
\xx \in B_{\delta}(\xx_0) \quad \implies  \quad f(\xx) \in B_{\e}(f(\xx_0))\,,
$$
which reads
$$
\| \xx - \xx_0 \| < \delta \quad \implies \quad
\| f(\xx) - f(\xx_0) \| < \e \,.
$$
Therefore $f$ is continuous at $\xx_0$ in the classical sense.




*Part 2.* Suppose $f$ is continuous at $x_0$ in the classical sense. 
Let $V \subset \R^m$ be open and such that $f(\xx_0) \in V$. Since $V$
is open, there exists $\e>0$ such that 
$$
B_{\e} (f(\xx_0)) \subset V \,.
$${#eq-proof-continuity-2}
Since $f$ is continous in the classical sense, there exists $\delta>0$ such that 
$$
  \| \xx - \xx_0 \| < \delta \quad \implies \|f(\xx) - f(\xx_0)\|< \e  \,.
$$
The above is equivalent to
$$
\xx \in B_{\delta}(\xx_0)  \quad \implies \quad f(\xx) \in B_{\e} (f (\xx_0))  \,.
$${#eq-proof-continuity-1}
Set 
$$
U:= B_{\delta}(\xx_0)
$$
and note that $U$ is open in $\R^n$ and $\xx_0 \in U$. By definition 
of image of a set, (@eq-proof-continuity-1) reads
$$
f(U) = f( B_{\delta}(\xx_0))   \subseteq  B_{\e} (f(\xx_0)) \,.
$$
Recalling (@eq-proof-continuity-2) we conclude that 
$$
f(U) \subset V \,.
$$
In summary, we have shown that given $V \subset \R^m$ open and such that $f(\xx_0) \in V$, there exists $U$ open in $\R^n$ such that $\xx_0 \in U$ and $f(U) \subset V$. Therefore $f$ is continuous at $\xx_0$ in the 
topological sense.

A similar proof yields the characterization of continuity in metric
spaces. The proof is left as an exercise. 


::: Proposition

Let $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$ be metric spaces. Denote by $\TT_X$ and $\TT_Y$ the topologies induced by the metrics. Let $f \colon X \to Y$ and $x_0 \in X$. They are equivalent:

1. $f$ is continuous at $x_0$ in the topological sense.
2. It holds:
$$
\forall \, \e > 0 \,, \, \exists \, \delta >0 \st \, d_Y(f(x),f(x_0))<\e \,\, 
\mbox{ if } \,\, d_X(x , x_0) < \delta \,.
$$

:::



Let us examine continuity in the cases of the trivial and discrete topologies.


::: Example
Let $(X,\TT_X)$ and $(Y,\TT_Y)$ be a topological space. Suppose that 
$\TT_Y$ is the trivial topology, that is,
$$
\TT_Y = \{ \emptyset, Y \} \,.
$$
Then every function $f \colon X \to Y$ is continuous. 


> Indeed, we know that $f$ is continuous if and only if it holds:
> $$
> f^{-1}(V) \in \TT_X \,, \quad \forall \,\, V \in \TT_Y \,.
> $$
> We have two cases:
>
>  - $V=\emptyset$: Then 
>  $$
>  f^{-1}(V) = f^{-1}(\emptyset) = \emptyset \in \TT_X \,.
>  $$
>  - $V=Y$: Then 
>  $$
>  f^{-1}(V) = f^{-1}(Y) = X \in \TT_X \,.
>  $$
>
> Therefore $f$ is continuous.

:::



::: Example
Let $(X,\TT_X)$ and $(Y,\TT_Y)$ be topological spaces. Suppose that 
$\TT_Y$ is the discrete topology, that is,
$$
\TT_Y = \{ V \st V \subseteq Y \} \,.
$$
Let $f \colon X \to Y$. They are equivalent:

1. $f$ is continuous from $X$ to $Y$.
2. $f^{-1}(\{y\}) \in \TT_X$ for all $y \in Y$.

In a topological space, continuity preserves limits
of sequences. 



::: {.Proposition #proposition-continuity-sequential}

Let $(X,\TT_X)$ and $(Y,\TT_Y)$ be topological spaces. Let 
$f \colon X \to Y$ be continuous. Let $\{x_n\} \subset X$
and $x_0 \in X$. We have
$$
x_n \to x_0 \,\, \mbox{ in }\, X \quad \implies \quad 
f(x_n) \to f(x_0) \,\, \mbox{ in }\, Y\,.
$$


:::



::: Proof

Let $V \in \TT_Y$ be such that $f(x_0) \in V$. Since $f$ is continuous there exists $U \in \TT_X$ with $x_0 \in U$ such that 
$$
f(U) \subset V \,.
$$
Since $U \in \TT_X$ and $x_n \to x_0$ in $X$, there exists $N \in \N$ such that
$$
x_n \in U \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
Therefore
$$
f(x_n) \in f(U) \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
Seeing that $f(U) \subset V$, we conclude 
$$
f(x_n) \in V \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,,
$$
showing that $f(x_n) \to f(x_0)$ in $Y$.

:::


::: Warning

The converse implication of Proposition \ref{proposition-continuity-sequential} is false. That is, even if it holds
$$
x_n \to x_0 \,\, \mbox{ in }\, X \quad \implies \quad 
f(x_n) \to f(x_0) \,\, \mbox{ in }\, Y\,.
$$
for all sequences $\{x_n\} \subset X$, the function $f$ might **not** be continuous. 
A counterexample is given in Example \ref{example-sequential-continuity} below.

For the above to hold, it is necessary for the topologies on
$X$ and $Y$ to be first countable, as for example is the case for metrizable topologies, see
Proposition \ref{proposition-sequential-continuity} below.

:::



::: {.Proposition  #proposition-sequential-continuity}

Let $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$ be metric spaces. Let $f \colon X \to Y$ and suppose that 
for all convergent sequences $\{x_n\} \subseteq X$, the sequence $\{f(x_n)\}$ is convergent in $Y$.
Then $f$ is continuous.

:::


::: Proof

Suppose by contradiction $f$ is not continuous at some point $x_0 \in X$. Then there exists
${\e}_0 >0$ such that, for all $\delta>0$ it holds
$$
d_Y(f(x),f(x_0)) > \e_0 \,, \quad d_X(x,x_0)<\delta \,. 
$$
We can therefore choose $\delta = 1/n$ and construct a sequence $\{x_n\} \subseteq X$ such that
$$
d_Y(f(x_n),f(x_0)) > \e_0 \,, \quad d_X(x_n,x_0)< \frac{1}{n} \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,. 
$$
Therefore $x_n \to x_0$ in $X$. Define the sequence
$$
y_n := 
\begin{cases}
x_n  & \,\, \mbox{ if } \, n \, \mbox{ even} \\
x_0  & \,\, \mbox{ if } \, n \, \mbox{ odd} 
\end{cases}
$$
As $x_n \to x_0$, we have $y_n \to x_0$. However $\{f(y_n)\}$ does not converge to any point in $Y$: Indeed $\{f(y_n)\}$ cannot converge to 
$f(x_0)$, since for $n$ even we have
$$
d_Y(f(y_n),f(x_0)) = d_Y(f(x_n),f(x_0)) > \e_0 \,. 
$$
Also $\{f(y_n)\}$ cannot converge to a point $y \neq f(x_0)$, since 
for $n$ odd
$$
d_Y (f(y_n), y) = d_Y (f(x_0), y) > 0 \,.
$$
Hence, we have produced a sequence $\{y_n\}$ which is convergent,
but such that $\{f(y_n)\}$ does not converge. This contradicts our assumption. Hence $f$ must be continuous. 


:::



::: {.Example  #example-sequential-continuity}

Consider $\R$ with the co-countable topology:
$$
{\TT}_{\textrm{cc}} := \{ A \subseteq \R \divider A^c = \R  \, \mbox{ or } \, A^c \, \mbox{ countable} \} \,.
$$
Sequences in $(\R,{\TT}_{\textrm{cc}})$ converge if and only if they are eventually constant. 
Also consider the discrete topology on $\R$, denoted by ${\TT}_{\textrm{discrete}}$. 
We have seen that sequences in $(\R,{\TT}_{\textrm{discrete}})$ converge if and only if they are
eventually constant. Consider the identity function
$$
f \colon (\R,{\TT}_{\textrm{cc}}) \to (\R,{\TT}_{\textrm{discrete}}) \,, \quad f(x):=x \,.
$$
We have that:

- $f$ is not continuous: Indeed $\{x\} \in {\TT}_{\textrm{discrete}}$ but 
$$
f^{-1}(\{ x\}) = \{x\} \notin {\TT}_{\textrm{cc}} \,,
$$
since $\{x\}^c$ is neither $\R$, nor countable.

- If $\{x_n\}$ is convergent in ${\TT}_{\textrm{cc}}$, then it is eventually constant. Therefore 
$\{f(x_n)\}$ is eventually constant, and so it is convergent in ${\TT}_{\textrm{discrete}}$.

Let us make an observation on continuity of compositions.


:::  Proposition

Let $(X,\TT_X), (Y,\TT_Y), (Z,\TT_Z)$ be topological spaces. Let

Let $C \in \TT_Z$. As $g$ is continuous, we have that

Since $f$ is continuous, we also have
$$
f^{-1} ( g^{-1}(C) ) \in \TT_X \,.

$$
(g \circ f)^{-1} ( C ) = f^{-1} ( g^{-1}(C) ) \in \TT_X \,,

so that $g \circ f$ is continuous.

We conclude the section by introducing homeomorphisms.

::: Definition
### Homeomoprhim

Let $(X,\TT_X)$, $(Y,\TT_Y)$ be topological space. A function $f \colon X \to Y$ is called an **homeomorphism** if they hold:

1. $f$ is continuous.
2. There exists $g \colon Y \to X$ continuous such that 
$$
g \circ f = {\id}_{X} \,, \quad f \circ g = {\id}_{Y}  \,.

The above is saying that $f$ is a homeomorphism if it is continuous and has continuous inverse. Homeomorphisms are the way we say that two topological spaces look the same.




## Subspace topology


Any subset $Y$ in a topological space $X$ inherits naturally a topological structure. Such structure is called **subspace topology**.


::: Definition
### Subspace topology   {#definition-subspace-topology}

$$
\SSS := \{ A \subset Y \divider \exists \,\, U \in \TT \st A = U \cap Y   \} \,.
$$
The family $\SSS$ is called subspace topology on $Y$ induced by the inclusion $Y \subset X$.

:::


::: Proof
### Well-posedness of Definition \ref{definition-subspace-topology}

We have to show that $(Y,\SSS)$ is a topological space:

- (A1) $\emptyset \in \SSS$ since
$$
\emptyset = \emptyset \cap Y
$$
and $\emptyset \in \TT$. Similarly we have $Y \in \SSS$, since
$$
Y = X \cap Y \,,
$$
and $X \in \TT$.

- (A2) Let $A_i \in \SSS$ for $i \in I$. By definition there exist $U_i \in \TT$ such that 
$$
A_i =  U_i \cap Y \,, \quad \forall \, i \in I \,.
$$
Therefore 
$$
\bigcup_{i \in I} \, A_i = 
\bigcup_{i \in I} (U_i \cap Y ) =
\left(\bigcup_{i \in I} U_i \right) \cap Y  \,.
$$
The above proves that $\cup_{i \in I} \, A_i \in \SSS$, since 
$\cup_{i \in I} \, U_i \in \TT$.

- (A3) Let $A_1, A_2 \in \SSS$. By definition there exist $U_1,U_2 \in \TT$ such that 
$$
A_1 =  U_1 \cap Y \,, \quad
A_2 =  U_2 \cap Y
$$
Therefore 
$$
A_1 \cap A_2  = (  U_1 \cap Y ) \cap (U_2 \cap Y) = (U_1 \cap U_2) \cap Y
$$
The above proves that $A_1 \cap A_2  \in \SSS$, since 
$U_1 \cap U_2 \in \TT$.
:::



If the set $Y$ is open, then sets are open in the subspace topology if
and only if they are open in $X$.


::: Proposition

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space and $Y \in \TT$ a subset. Let
$A \subset Y$. Then
$$
A \in \SSS \quad \iff \quad A \in \TT \,.

::: Proof
Suppose $A \in \SSS$. Then there exists $U \in \TT$ such that
$$
A = U \cap Y \,. 
$$
Since $U, Y \in \TT$, by property (A3) of topologies it follows 
that 
$$
A = U \cap Y  \in \TT \,. 
$$

Conversely, assume that $A \in \TT$. Then
$$
A = A \cap Y \,,
$$
showing that $A \in \SSS$.
:::




::: Warning

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space, $A \subset Y \subset X$. In general we could have
$$
A \in \SSS \quad \mbox{and} \quad A \notin \TT
$$

> For example consider $X=\R$ with $\TT$ the euclidean topology. Consider the subset $Y = [0,2)$ and equip $Y$ with the subspace topology $\SSS$. Let $A = [0,1)$. Then $A \notin \TT$ but $A \in \SSS$, since 
$$
A =  (-1,1)  \cap Y
$$
and $(-1,1) \in \TT$.

:::




::: Example

Let $X=\R$ be equipped with $\TT$ the euclidean topology. Let 
$\SSS$ be the subspace topology on $\Z$. Then $\SSS$ coincides with
the discrete topology.

> *Proof.* The set $\{z\}$ is open in $\SSS$ for all $z \in \Z$. Indeed, 
$$
\{z\} = \left(  z-1 , z + 1   \right)   \cap \Z \,
$$
and $(z - 1, z + 1) \in \TT$. Thus $\{z\} \in \SSS$. Let now $A \subseteq \Z$. Then
$$
A = \bigcup_{z \in A} \, \{ z \} \,,
$$
and therefore $A \in \SSS$ by (A2). This proves that
$$
\SSS = \{ A \st A \subseteq \Z \} \,,
$$
that is, $\SSS$ is the discrete topology on $\Z$.

## Topological basis


We have seen that in metric spaces every open set is union of 
open balls, see Propostion \ref{proposition-metric-ball}. We can then

In this context, we call the open balls a basis for the topology. 

We can generalize the concept of basis to arbitrary topological spaces.

$\mathcal{B}$ is a **topological basis** for the topology $\TT$ if for all $U \in \TT$ 
there exist open sets $\{B_i\} \subseteq \mathcal{B}$, with $I$ family of indices, such that 
$$
U = \bigcup_{i \in I} \, B_i \,.

- (B2) If $U_1,U_2 \in \mathcal{B}$ then there exist $\{B_i \} \subseteq \mathcal{B}$ such that

- (B1) This holds because $X \in \TT$. Therefore by definition of basis there exist $B_i \in \mathcal{B}$ such that

Therefore taking the union over all $B \in \mathcal{B}$ yields $X$, and (B1) follows.

- (B2) Let $U_1 , U_2 \in \mathcal{B}$. Then $U_1 , U_2 \in \TT$, since  $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \TT$. By property 
(A3) we get that $U_1 \cap U_2 \in \TT$. Since $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis we conclude (B2).

2. $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for $\TT$.

1. We need to verify that $\TT$ is a topology:

- (A1) We have that $X \in \TT$ by (B1). Moreover $\emptyset \in \TT$, since $\emptyset$ can be obtained as empty union. Therefore (A1) holds.

- (A2) Let $U_i \in \TT$ for all $i \in I$. By definition of $\TT$ we have
$$
U_i = \bigcup_{k \in K_i} \, B_k^i  
$$
for some family of indices $K_i$ and $B_k^i \in \mathcal{B}$. Therefore 
$$
U := \bigcup_{i \in I} \, U_i  = \bigcup_{i \in I, \, k \in K_i} \,  B_k^i \,,
$$
showing that $U \in \TT$.

- (A3) Suppose that $U_1, U_2 \in \TT$. Then 
$$
U_1 = \bigcup_{i \in I_1} \, B_i^1 \,, \quad 
U_2 = \bigcup_{i \in I_2} \, B_i^2
$$
for $B_i^1,B_i^2 \in \mathcal{B}$. From the above we have
$$
U_1 \cap U_2 = \bigcup_{ i \in I_1 ,\, k \in I_2 } \, B_i^1 \cap B_k^2 \,.
$$
From property (B2) we have that for each pair of indices $(i,k)$ the set
$B_i^1 \cap B_k^2$ is the union of sets in $\mathcal{B}$. Therefore 
$U_1 \cap U_2$ is union of sets in $\mathcal{B}$, showing that $U_1 \cap U_2 \in \TT$.


2. This trivially follows from defintion of $\TT$ and definition of basis.

## Product topology


Given two topological spaces $(X,\TT_X)$ and $(Y,\TT_Y)$ we would like to 
equip the cartesian product
$$
X \times Y  = \{  (x,y) \divider x \in X \,, \,\, y \in Y \} 
$$
with a topology. We proceed as follows.


::: Proposition
 
Let $(X,\TT_X)$ and $(Y,\TT_Y)$ be topological spaces. Define the family $\mathcal{B}$ of subsets
of $X \times Y$ as
$$
\mathcal{B} := \{   U \times V \divider U \in \TT_X \,, \,\, V \in \TT_Y  \} \subset X \times Y \,.
$$
Then $\mathcal{B}$ satisfies properties (B1) and (B2) from Proposition \ref{proposition-basis}. 


:::


The proof is an easy check, and is left as an exercise. As $\mathcal{B}$ 
satisfies (B1)-(B2), by Proposition \ref{proposition-topology-basis} we
know that 
$$
\TT_{X \times Y} := \left\{  U \times V  \divider U \times V = \bigcup_{i \in I} B_i \,, ,\,\, B_i \in \mathcal{B}     \right\} 
$${#eq-product-topology}
is a topology on $X \times Y$. 


::: Definition
### Product topology

Let $(X,\TT_X)$ and $(Y,\TT_Y)$ be topological spaces. We call 
$\TT_{X \times Y}$ at (@eq-product-topology) the **product topology** on $X \times Y$.

:::


::: Example 

Let $\R$ be equipped with the Euclidean topology. The product topology on $\R \times \R$ coincides with the topology 
on $\R^2$ equipped with the Euclidean topology. 

:::


Consider the projection maps
$$
\pi_X \colon X \times Y \to X   \,, \quad \pi_X (x,y):=x 
$$
and 
$$
\pi_Y \colon X \times Y \to Y   \,, \quad \pi_Y (x,y):=y 
$$


::: Proposition 

Let $(X,\TT_X)$ and $(Y,\TT_Y)$ be topological spaces and equip $X \times Y$ with the product topology $\TT_{X \times Y}$. Then $\pi_X$ and $\pi_Y$
are continuous.

:::

::: Proof

Let $U \in \TT_X$. Then
$$
{\pi}_{X}^{-1} (U) = U \times Y \,.
$$
We have that $U \times Y \in \TT_{X \times Y}$ since $U \in \TT_X$ and 
$Y \in \TT_Y$. Therefore $\pi_X$ is continuous. The proof that $\pi_Y$ is 
continuous is similar, and is left as an exercise.

:::



The following proposition gives a useful criterion to check
whether a map into $X \times Y$ is continuous.

::: Proposition

Let $(X,\TT_X)$ and $(Y,\TT_Y)$ be topological spaces and equip $X \times Y$ with the product topology $\TT_{X \times Y}$. Let $(Z,\TT_Z)$ be a topological space and 
$$
f \colon Z \to X \times Y
$$
a function. They are equivalent:

1. $f$ is continuous.
2. The compositions
$$
\pi_X \circ f \colon Z \to X  \,, \quad  
\pi_Y \circ f \colon Z \to Y
$$
are continuous.

:::


The proof is left as an exercise. 



## Connectedness 


Suppose that $(X,\TT)$ is a topological space. By property (A1) we have
that 
$$
\emptyset \,, \,\, X \in \TT 
$$
Therefore 
$$
\emptyset^c = X \,, \quad X^c = \emptyset 
$$
are closed. It follows that $\emptyset$ and $X$ are both open and closed.


::: Definition
### Connected space

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space. We say that:

- $X$ is **connected** if the only subsets of $X$ which are both open and closed are $\emptyset$ and $X$. 
- $X$ is **disconnected** if it is not connected.

:::


The following proposition gives two extremely useful equivalent 
definitions of connectedness. Before stating it, we define the concept of proper set.


::: Definition
### Proper subset

Let $X$ be a set. A subset $A \subseteq X$ is **proper** if 
$$
A \neq \emptyset \,, \quad A \neq X \,.
$$

:::


::: Proposition
### Equivalent definition for connectedness {#proposition-connected-equivalent}

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space. They are equivalent:

1. $X$ is disconnected.
2. $X$ is the disjoint union of two proper open subsets.
3. $X$ is the disjoint union of two proper closed subsets. 

:::


::: Proof

*Part 1. Point 1 implies Points 2 and 3.* 

Suppose $X$ is disconnected. Then there exists $U \subseteq X$ which is open, closed, and such that 
$$
U \neq \emptyset \,, \quad U \neq X \,.
$${#eq-proof-connected-1}
Define 
$$
A:= U \,, \quad B:= U^c \,.
$$
By definition of complement we have
$$
X = A \cup B  \,, \quad A \cap B = \emptyset \,.
$$
Moreover:

- $A$ and $B$ are both open and closed, since $U$ is both
open and closed. 

- $A$ and $B$ are proper, since (@eq-proof-connected-1) holds.

Therefore we conclude Points 2, 3. 


*Part 2. Point 2 implies Point 1.* Suppose $A,B$ are open, proper, and such that
$$
X = A \cup B \,, \quad  A \cap B = \emptyset \,.
$$
This implies 
$$
A^c = X \smallsetminus A = B \,, 
$$
showing that $A^c$ is open, and hence $A$ is closed. Therefore
$A$ is proper, open and closed, showing that $X$ is disconnected.



*Part 3. Point 3 implies Point 1.* Suppose $A,B$ are closed, proper, and such that
$$
X = A \cup B \,, \quad  A \cap B = \emptyset \,.
$$
This implies 
$$
A^c = X \smallsetminus A = B \,, 
$$
showing that $A^c$ is closed, and hence $A$ is open. Therefore
$A$ is proper, open and closed, showing that $X$ is disconnected.


:::


In the following we will use Point 2 and Point 3 in Proposition \ref{proposition-connected-equivalent} as equivalent 
definitions of disconnected topological space.


::: Example

Consider the set $X = \{0,1\}$ with the subspace topology induced by the inclusion $X \subset \R$, where $\R$ is equipped with the
Euclidean topology $\TT_{\textrm{euclidean}}$. Then $X$ is disconnected.

> *Proof.* Note that 
$$
X = \{ 0 \} \cup \{ 1 \} \,, \quad \{ 0 \} \cap \{ 1 \} = \emptyset \,.
$$
The set $\{ 0 \}$ is open for the subspace topology, since
$$
\{ 0 \} = X \cap (-1,1) \,, \quad 
(-1,1) \in \TT_{\textrm{euclidean}} \,.
$$
Similarly, also $\{ 1 \}$ is open for the subspace topology, since
$$
\{ 1 \} = X \cap (0,2) \,, \quad 
(0,2) \in \TT_{\textrm{euclidean}} \,.
$$
Clearly 
$$
\{ 0 \} \neq \emptyset \,, \quad \{ 1 \} \neq \emptyset \,,
$$
showing that $X$ is disconnected.

:::


::: {.Example  #example-R-minus-p}

Let $p \in \R$. The set $X = \R \smallsetminus \{p\}$ is disconnected. 

> *Proof.* Define the sets 
$$ 
A = (-\infty,p) \,, \quad B = (p , \infty) \,.
$$
Then $A,B$ are proper subsets of $X$, since $p \notin X$. Moreover 
$$
X = A \cup B \,,  \quad A \cap B = \emptyset \,.
$$
Finally we have that $A,B$ are open for the subspace topology, since
they are open in $\R$. Therefore $X$ is disconnected.

:::


::: {.Example   #example-Rn-minus-p}

Let $n \geq 2$ and $A \subseteq \R^n$ be open and connected. Let $p \in A$. Then $X = A \smallsetminus \{p\}$ is connected. 

> Exercise: Prove that $X$ is connected.

:::



The next theorem shows that connectedness is preserved by continuous maps.


::: {.Theorem #theorem-connected}

Let $(X,\TT_X)$, $(Y,\TT_Y)$ be topological spaces. Suppose that
$f \colon X \to Y$ is continuous and let $f(X) \subseteq Y$ be 
equipped with the subspace topology. If $X$ is connected, then $f(X)$ is connected. 

:::


::: Proof

Suppose that $A,B$ are open in $f(X)$ and such that
$$
f(X) = A \cup B \,, \quad A \cap B = \emptyset \,.
$$
if we show that
$$
A = \emptyset \,\, \mbox{ or } \,\, B = \emptyset 
$${#eq-proof-connected-3}
the proof is concluded. Since $A,B$ are open for the subspace topology, there exist $\widetilde{A}, \widetilde{B} \in \TT_Y$ such that
$$
A = \widetilde{A} \cap f(X) \,, \quad
B = \widetilde{B} \cap f(X) \,.
$${#eq-proof-connected-4}
Since $f(X) = A \cup B$ we have
\begin{align*}
X & = {f}^{-1} (A \cup B) \\
  & = {f}^{-1} (A ) \cup {f}^{-1} (B) \\
  & =  {f}^{-1} (\widetilde{A} ) \cup {f}^{-1} (\widetilde{B})
\end{align*}
where in the last equality we used (@eq-proof-connected-4). Since 
$A \cap B = \emptyset$, we also have that
\begin{align*}
{f}^{-1} (\widetilde{A} ) \cap {f}^{-1} (\widetilde{B}) 
  & = {f}^{-1} (A ) \cap {f}^{-1} (B) \\
  & =  {f}^{-1} (A \cap B) \\
  & =  {f}^{-1} (\emptyset) \\
  & = \emptyset 
\end{align*}
where in the first equality we used (@eq-proof-connected-4).
By continuity of $f$ we have that 
$$
f^{-1}(\widetilde{A}) \,, \,\, 
f^{-1}(\widetilde{B}) \in \TT_X \,.
$$
Therefore, using that $X$ is connected, we deduce that
$$
f^{-1}(\widetilde{A}) = \emptyset \,\, \mbox{ or } \,\, 
f^{-1}(\widetilde{B}) = \emptyset \,.
$$
The above implies
$$
\widetilde{A} \cap f(X) = \emptyset \,\, \mbox{ or } \,\, 
\widetilde{B} \cap f(X) = \emptyset \,.
$$
Recalling (@eq-proof-connected-4), we obtain (@eq-proof-connected-3), ending the proof.
:::

An immediate corollary of Theorem \ref{theorem-connected} is that
connectedness is a topological invariant, e.g., connectedness is
preserved by homeomorphisms.  


::: {.Corollary  #corollary-invariant-connected}

Let $(X,\TT_X)$, $(Y,\TT_Y)$ be homeomorhic topological spaces. 
Then
$$
X \, \mbox{ is connected } \,\, \iff \,\,
Y \, \mbox{ is connected } 
$$

:::

The proof follows immediately by Theorem \ref{theorem-connected}, and is left to the reader as an exercise.



::: Example

Let $n \geq 2$. $\R^n$ not homeomorphic to $\R$.

> *Proof.*  Suppose by contradiction that there exists an omeomorphism 
$$
f \colon \R^n \to \R \,.
$$
Define $p = f(0)$ and the restriction
$$
g \colon \R^n \smallsetminus \{0\} \to \R \smallsetminus \{p\} \,, \quad g(x) = f(x) \,.
$$
Since $g$ is a restriction of an omeomorphism, then $g$ is an omeomorphism. 
We have that $\R^n \smallsetminus \{0\}$ is connected, as a consequence of  
Example \ref{example-Rn-minus-p}. Hence, by Corollary \ref{corollary-invariant-connected}, we infer that $\R \smallsetminus \{p\}$ is connected. This is a contradiction, since $\R \smallsetminus \{p\}$ is
disconnected, as shown in Example \ref{example-R-minus-p}.

:::



::: Example

Define the 1D unit circle
$$
\sphere^1 := \{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \, \colon \, x^2 + y^2 = 1 \} \,.
$$
Then $\sphere^1$ and $[0,1]$ are not homeomorphic. 


> *Proof.* Suppose by contradiction that there exists and omeomorphism
	$$
	f  \colon [0,1] \to \mathbb{S}^1 \,.
	$$
	The restriction of $f$ to $[0,1] \smallsetminus \{\frac12\}$ defines an omeomorphism 
	$$
	g \ \colon \left( [0,1] \smallsetminus \left\{\frac12\right\} \right) \to \left( \sphere^1 \smallsetminus \{\mathbf{p}\} \right) \,, \quad \mathbf{p} := f\left(\frac12 \right) \,.
	$$
	The set $[0,1] \smallsetminus \left\{ \frac12 \right\}$ is disconnected, 
	since 
	$$
	[0,1] \smallsetminus \{1/2\} = [0,1/2) \, \cup \, (1/2,1] 
	$$
	with $[0,1/2)$ and $(1/2,1]$ open for the subset topology, non-empty and disjoint. Therefore, using that $g$ is an omeomorphism, we conclude that also $\sphere^1 \smallsetminus \{\mathbf{p}\}$ is disconnected. Let $\theta_0 \in [0,2\pi)$ be the unique angle such that 
	$$
	\mathbf{p} = (\cos (\theta_0),\sin(\theta_0)) \,.
	$$
	Thus $\sphere^1 \smallsetminus \{\mathbf{p}\}$ is parametrized by
	$$
	\g(t):=(\cos(t),\sin(t)) \,, \quad t \in (\theta_0,\theta_0 + 2\pi) \,.
	$$ 
	Since $\g$ is continuous and $(\theta_0,\theta_0 + 2\pi)$ is connected, by Theorem \ref{theorem-connected}, we conclude that $\sphere^1 \smallsetminus \{\mathbf{p}\}$ is connected. Contradiction.

## Intermediate Value Theorem


Another consequence of Theorem \ref{theorem-connected} is a generalization of the Intermediate Value 
Theorem to arbitrary topological spaces. Before providing 
statement and proof of such Theorem, we need to characterize the connected subsets of $\R$. 


::: Definition
### Interval

A subset $I \subset \R$ is an interval if it holds:
$$
\forall \, a,b \in I \,, \, x \in \R  \, \st a<x<b \quad 
\implies \quad x \in I \,.
$$

:::

::: {.Theorem  #theorem-interval-connected}

Let $\R$ be equipped with the Euclidean topology and let $I \subseteq \R$. They are equivalent:

1. $I$ is connected.
2. $I$ is an interval.

:::


::: Proof

*Part 1.* Suppose $I$ is connected. If $I=\{p\}$ for some $p \in \R$ then $I$ is an interval and the thesis is achieved. Otherwise there exist $a,b \in I$ with $a<b$. Assume that $x \in \R$ is such that 
$$
a < x < b \,.
$$
We need to show that $x \in I$. Suppose by contradiction that
$x \notin I$ and define the open sets
$$
A = (-\infty,x) \,, \quad B = (x,\infty) \,.
$$
Then
$$
\widetilde{A} = (-\infty,x) \cap I \,, \quad \widetilde{B} = (x,\infty) \cap I
$$ 
are open in $I$ for the subspace topology. Clearly
$$
\widetilde{A}  \cap \widetilde{B} = \emptyset  \,.
$$
Moreover
$$
I = \widetilde{A} \cup \widetilde{B}
$$
since $x \notin I$. We have:

- Since $a<x$ and $a \in I$, we have that $a \in \widetilde{A}$. Therefore $\widetilde{A} \neq \emptyset$.
- Similarly, $b>x$ and $b \in I$, therefore $b \in \widetilde{B}$. Hence $\widetilde{B} \neq \emptyset$. 

Therefore $I$ is disconnected, which is a contradiction.

*Part 2.* Suppose $I$ is an interval. Suppose by contradiction that $I$ is 
disconnected. Then there exist $A,B$ proper and closed, such that 
$$
I = A \cup B \,, \quad A \cap B = \emptyset \,.
$$
Since $A$ and
$B$ are proper, there exist points $a \in A$, $b \in B$. WLOG we
can assume $a<b$. Define 
$$
\alpha = \sup \ S \,, \quad S:= \{ x \in \R  \colon [a,x) \cap I \subseteq A \} \,.
$$

Note that $\alpha$ exists finite since $b$ is an upper bound for the set $S$.

> Suppose by contradiction $b$ is not an upper bound for $S$. Hence there exists $x \in \R$ such that $[a,x) \cap I \subseteq A$ and that $x>b$. As $b>a$, we conclude that $b \in [a,x) \cap I \subseteq A$. Thus $b \in A$, which
is a contradiction, since $b \in B$ and $A \cap B = \emptyset$.

Moreover we have that $\alpha \in A$.

> This is because the supremum $\alpha$ is the limit of a sequence in $S$, and hence of a sequence in $A$. Therefore $\alpha$ belongs to $\overline{A}$. Since 
$A$ is closed, we infer $\alpha \in A$.

Note that $A^c = B$, which is closed. Therefore $A^c$ is closed, showing 
that $A$ is open. As $\alpha \in A$ and $A$ is open in $I$, there exists $\e>0$ such that
$$
(\alpha - \e , \alpha + \e) \cap I \subseteq A \,.
$$
In particular 
$$
[a , \alpha + \e) \cap I \subseteq A \,,
$$
showing that $\alpha + \e \in S$. This is a contradiction, since $\alpha$ is the supremum of $S$.

:::




We are finally ready to prove the Intermediate Value Theorem.



::: Theorem
### Intermediate Value Theorem

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a connected topological space. Suppose that 
$f \colon X \to \R$ is continuous. Suppose that $a,b \in X$ are such that $f(a)<f(b)$. It holds:
$$
\forall \, c \in \R \st f(a)< c < f(b) \,, \,\, \exists \, \xi \in X \st f(\xi) = c \,.
$$

:::


::: Proof

As $f$ is continuous and $X$ is connected, by Theorem \ref{theorem-connected} we know that $f(X)$ is connected in $\R$. By Theorem \ref{theorem-interval-connected} we have that $f(X)$ is an interval. Since $a,b \in X$ it follows
$f(a), f(b) \in f(X)$. Therefore, if $c \in \R$ is such that
$$
f(a) < c < f(b)
$$
we conclude that $c \in f(X)$, since $f(X)$ is an interval. 
Hence there exists $\xi \in X$ such that $f(\xi) = c$.

:::









## Path connectedness



::: Definition
### Path connectedness

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space. We say that $X$ is **path connected** if for every $x,y \in X$ there exist $a,b \in \R$ with $a<b$, and a
continuous function 
$$
\alpha \colon [a,b] \to X 
$$
such that 
$$
\alpha (a) = x \,, \quad \alpha(b) = y \,.
$$

:::




::: Example

Let $A \subset \R^n$ be convex. Then $A$ is path connected.


> A is convex if for all $x,y \in A$ the segment connecting $x$ to $y$ is contained in $A$, namely,
$$
[x,y] := \{ (1-t)x + t y \divider t \in [0,1] \} \subseteq A \,.
$$
Therefore we can define
$$
\alpha \colon [0,1] \to A \,, \quad \alpha(t):=(1-t)x + t y \,.
$$
Clearly $\alpha$ is continuous, and $\alpha(0)=x, \alpha(1)=y$.
:::





It turns out that path-connectedness implies connectedness.



::: {.Theorem  #theorem-path-connected}

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a path connected topological space. Then $X$ is connected.

:::


::: Proof 

Suppose that $X = A \cup B$ with $A, B \in \TT$ and non-empty. In order to conclude that
$X$ is connected, we need to show that
$$
A \cap B \neq \emptyset \,.
$$
Since $A$ and $B$ are non-empty, we can find two points $x \in A$ and $b \in B$. As $X$ is path connected, there exists $\alpha \colon [0,1] \to X$ continuous such that 
$$
\alpha(0) = x \,,  
\quad 
\alpha(1) = y \,.
$$
In particular 
$$
\alpha^{-1} (A) \neq \emptyset \, , \quad
\alpha^{-1} (B) \neq \emptyset \,.
$$
Moreover
\begin{align*}
[0,1] & = \alpha^{-1}(X) \\
      & = \alpha^{-1}(A \cup B) \\
      & = \alpha^{-1}(A) \cup \alpha^{-1}(B) \,.
\end{align*}
As $\alpha$ is continuous, $\alpha^{-1}(A)$ and $\alpha^{-1}(B)$ are open in $[0,1]$. 
Suppose by contradiction that $A \cap B = \emptyset$. Then
$$
\alpha^{-1}(A) \cap \alpha^{-1}(B) = \alpha^{-1}(A \cap B)  = \alpha^{-1}(\emptyset) = \emptyset \,.
$$
Hence $[0,1]$ is disconnected, which is a contradiction. Therefore $A \cap B \neq \emptyset$ and 
$X$ is connected.

:::



The converse of the above theorem does not hold. A counterexample
is given by the so-called **topologist curve**, which will be examined in
Proposition \ref{proposition-topologist-curve}. Prior to this, we need a basic Lemma.


::: {.Lemma #lemma-connected-open-closed}

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space. Let $A,  U \subseteq X$ with $A$ connected and $U$ open and closed. Suppose that $A \cap U \neq \emptyset$,  then $A \subseteq U$.
 
:::


::: Proof

The following set identities hold for any pair of sets $U$ and $A$:
\begin{align*}
A & = ( A \cap U ) \cup (A \cap U^c)  \\
\emptyset & = ( A \cap U ) \cap (A \cap U^c) 
\end{align*}
Now, suppose by contradiction $A \not\subseteq U$. This means $A \cap U^c \neq \emptyset$. By assumption we also have $A \cap U \neq \emptyset$. Moreover the sets $A \cap U$ and $A \cap U^c$ are open for the subspace topology on $A$, since $U$ and $U^c$ are open in $X$. Hence $A$ is the disjoint union of non-empty open sets, showing that $A$ is disconnected. Contradiction. We conclude that $A \subseteq U$.

:::


::: Proposition 
### Topologist curve  {#proposition-topologist-curve}

Consider $\R^2$ with the Euclidean topology and define the sets
$$
X := A \cup B 
$$
where 
\begin{align*}
A & := \left\{   \left(  t, \sin \left( \frac{1}{t} \right)  \right) \divider t>0   \right\} \\
B & := \{(0,t) \divider t \in [-1,1] \} 
\end{align*}
Then $X$ is connected, but not path connected.


:::


::: Proof

*Step 1. $X$ is not path connected.* 

Let $x \in A$ and $y \in B$. There is no continuous function $\alpha \colon [0,1] \to X$ such that $\alpha(0)=x$ and $\alpha(1)=y$. If such $\alpha$ existed, then we would obtain a continuous extension for $t=0$ of the
function 
$$
f(t) = \sin \left( \frac{1}{t} \right)  \,, \quad x>0
$$
which is not possible. Hence $X$ is not path connected.


*Step 2. Preliminary facts.* 


- $A$ is connected: Define the curve $\g \colon (0,\infty) \to \R^2$ by
$$
\g (t):=   \left(  t, \sin \left( \frac{1}{t} \right)  \right) \,.
$$
Clearly $\g$ is continuous. Since $(0,\infty)$ is 
connected, by Theorem \ref{theorem-connected} we have that 
$\g((0,\infty)) = A$ is connected.

- $B$ is connected: Indeed $B$ is homeomorphic to the interval $[-1,1]$. Since $[-1,1]$ is connected, by
Corollary \ref{corollary-invariant-connected} we conclude that $B$ is connected.

- $\closure{A} = X$: 
  This is because each point $y \in B$ is of the form $y = (0,t_0)$ for some $t_0 \in [-1,1]$. By continuity of $\sin$ and the Intermediate Value Theorem there exists some $z>0$ such that
  $$
  \sin(z) = t_0 \,.
  $$
  Therefore $z_n := z + 2n\pi$ satisfies
  $$
  z_n \to \infty \,, \quad \sin(z_n) = t_0 \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
  $$
  Define $s_n:=1/z_n$. Trivially
  $$
  s_n \to 0 \,, \quad  \sin \left(  \frac{1}{s_n}  \right) = t_0 \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
  $$
  Therefore we obtain
  $$
  \left(  s_n , \sin \left(  \frac{1}{s_n}  \right)    \right) \to  (0,t_0) \,.
  $$
  Hence the set $B$ is contained in the set $L(A)$ of limit points of $A$.
  Since we are in $\R^2$, we have that $L(A)=\closure{A}$, proving that $B \subseteq \closure{A}$. Thus $\closure{A}= A \cup B = X$. 
  



*Step 3. $X$ is connected.*  

Let $U \subseteq X$ be non-empty, open and closed. If we prove that
$U = X$, we conclude that $X$ is connected. Let us proceed.  
Since $U$ is non-empty, we can fix a point $x \in U$. We have two
possibilities:

- $x \in A$: In this case $A \cap U \neq \emptyset$. Since $A$ is connected and $U$ is open and closed, by Lemma \ref{lemma-connected-open-closed} we conclude $A \subseteq U$. As $U$ is closed and contains $A$, then $\closure{A} \subseteq U$. But we have shown that  
  $$
  \closure{A} = X \,,
  $$
  and therefore $U = X$. 

- $x \in B$: Then $U \cap B \neq \emptyset$. Since $B$ is connected and $U$ is open and closed, we can invoke Lemma \ref{lemma-connected-open-closed} and conclude that $B \subseteq U$. Since $(0,0) \in B$, it follows that
$$
(0,0) \in U \,.
$$
As $U$ is open in $X$, and $X$ has the subspace topology induced by the inclusion $X \subseteq \R^2$, there exists an open set $W$ of $\R^2$ such that
$$
U = X \cap W \,.
$$
Therefore $(0,0) \in W$. As $W$ is open in $\R^2$, there exists a radius $\e>0$ such that 
$$
B_{\e} (0,0) \subseteq W \,.
$$
Hence 
$$
X \cap B_{\e} (0,0)  \subseteq X \cap W = U \,.
$$
The ball $B_{\e} (0,0)$ contains points of $A$, and therefore 
$$
A \cap U \neq \emptyset \,.
$$
Since $A$ is connected and $U$ is open and closed, we can again use 
Lemma \ref{lemma-connected-open-closed} and obtain that 
$A \subseteq U$. Since we already had $B \subseteq U$, and since 
$U \subseteq X = A \cup B$, we conclude hence $U = X$.


Therefore $U = X$ in all possible cases, showing that $X$ is connected.

## Compactness


The first compactness result that one encounters in Analysis is the Heine-Borel Theorem.


::: Theorem
### Heine-Borel

Let $I \subseteq \R$. They are equivalent:

1. $I$ is compact.
2. $I$ is closed and bounded.

:::

What does is mean for $I$ to be compact? In the Analysis course it means that every sequence
$\{x_n\} \subseteq I$ has a convergent subsequence. 
When trying to generalize compactness to general topological spaces there will be two issues:

1. The definition of compactness we just gave is too weak.
2. The Heine-Borel Theorem does not hold in general topological space.

The topological definition of compactenss is given through open covers.
