# Surfaces


Curves are 1D objects in $\R^3$, parametrized via functions $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$. 
There is only one available direction in which to move on a curve:

- $t \mapsto \g(t)$ moves forward on the curve 
- $t \mapsto \g(-t)$ moves backward on the curve


![Sketch of a curve $\g$.](/images/curves_example.png){width=60%}


Surfaces are 2D objects in $\R^3$. There are two directions in which one can move on a surface.

::: Question

How to dercribe a surface mathematically?

:::


A curve $\Gamma \subseteq \R^3$ can be described with one function $\g \colon (a,b) \to \Gamma$. The idea is that $\Gamma$ looks locally like $\R$.


![A curve $\Gamma$ can be described by a function $\g \colon (a,b) \to \Gamma$.](/images/curves_example_2.png){width=60%}


How do we represent a surface? Suppose given a function $\sss \colon U \to \R^3$, with $U \subseteq \R^2$ open set. Denote by $\SSS := \sss(U)$ the image of $U$ through $\sss$. We say that $\SSS$ is a surface and $\sss$ is a **chart**. Unofortunately, not all surfaces can be described with just one chart: in most cases one needs to piece together many local **charts** $\sss_i \colon U_i \to \SSS$, with $U_i \subseteq \R^2$ open. The charts $\sss_i$ represent $\SSS$ if they cover the whole surface:
$$
\SSS = \bigcup_{i} \sss_i (U_i) \,.
$$


![A surface $\SSS$ can be described by a family of charts $\sss_i \colon U_i \to \SSS$ with $U_i \subseteq \R^2$ open set.](/images/surfaces_example_2.png){width=60%}

Before proceeding with the formal definition of surface, we collect some preliminary definitions and results.


## Preliminaries


Before proceeding with the formal definition of surface, we need to establish
some basic notation and terminology regarding linear algebra, the topology of $\R^n$, and calculus for smooth maps from $\R^n$ into $\R^m$.




### Linear algebra



::: Definition
### Bilinear form

Let $V$ be a vector space and $B \colon V \times V \to \R$. 
We say that:

- $B$ is **bilinear** if
\begin{align*}
B(\lambda_1 \vv_1 + \lambda_2 \vv_2 , \ww) & = \lambda_1 B(\vv_1,\ww) + \lambda_2 B(\vv_2,\ww) \,, \\
B(\ww, \lambda_1 \vv_1 + \lambda_2 \vv_2 ) & = \lambda_1 B(\ww,\vv_1) + \lambda_2 B(\ww, \vv_2) \,. 
\end{align*}
for all $\vv_i,\ww \in V$, $\lambda_i \in \R$.

- $B$ is **symmetric** if 
$$
B(\vv,\ww) = B(\ww, \vv) 
$$
for all $\vv,\ww \in V$.


A bilinear map $B$ is called **bilinear form** on $V$.

:::



::: Notation

Let $V$ be a vector space with basis $\{\vv_1,\ldots,\vv_n\}$. Then, for 
a vector $\vv \in V$ there exist coefficients $\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n$
such that
$$
\vv = \lambda_1 \vv_1 +  \ldots  +\lambda_n \vv_n \,.
$$
We denote the vector of coefficients of $\vv$ by the column vector
$$
\xx := (\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n)^T \in \R^n \,.
$$
The coefficients of a vector $\ww$ are denoted by
$$
\yy := (\mu_1 , \ldots, \mu_n )^T \,. 
$$
Notice that we are using different letters to denote abstract vectors $\vv,\ww \in V$, and their components $\xx,\yy \in \R^n$.

:::


Bilinear forms can be represented by a matrix.



::: Remark
### Matrix representation for bilinear forms

Let $\{\vv_1, \ldots , \vv_n \}$ be a basis for the vector space $V$. 
Given a bilinear form $B \colon V \times V \to \R$ we define the matrix
$$
M := \left(  B(\vv_i,\vv_j) \right)_{i,j=1}^n \in \R^{n \times n} \,.
$$
Then 
$$
B(\vv,\ww) = \xx^T \,M \, \yy \,. 
$$

> *Proof.* We can write $\vv$ and $\ww$ in cordinates as
$$
\vv = \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i \vv_i \,, \quad 
\ww = \sum_{i=1}^n \mu_i \vv_i \,,
$$
for suitable coefficients $\lambda_i, \mu_i \in \R$. Using bilinearity of $B$
we get
\begin{align*}
B(\vv,\ww) & = B \left(  \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i \vv_i, \sum_{j=1}^n \mu_j \vv_j   \right) \\
           & = \sum_{i,j=1}^n \lambda_i \mu_j B(\vv_i,\vv_j) \\
           & = \xx^T M \yy \,.
\end{align*}

:::



::: Definition 
### Quadratic form

Let $V$ be a vector space and $B \colon V \times V \to \R$ be a bilinear form. The **quadratic** form associated to $B$ is the map 
$$
Q \colon V \to \R \,, \quad Q(\vv) := B(\vv, \vv) \,.
$$


:::


A symmetric bilinear form is uniquely determinded by its quadratic form, 
as stated in the following proposition.


::: Proposition

Let $B \colon V \times V \to \R$ be a symmetric bilinear form and 
$Q \colon V \to \R$ the associated quadratic form. Then
$$
B(u,v) = \frac12 \left(  Q(\vv + \ww) - Q(\vv) - Q(\ww)       \right) \,.
$$
for all $\vv,\ww \in V$.

:::

The proof is an easy check, and is left as an exercise.


::: Definition 
### Inner product

Let $V$ be a vector space. An inner product on $V$ is a symmetric bilinear form $\scp{\cdot}{\cdot} \colon V \times V \to \R$ such that
$$
\scp{\vv}{\vv} > 0 \,, \quad \forall \, \vv \in V \,.
$$
Moreover:

- The **length** of a vector $\vv \in V$ with respect to $B$ is defined as
$$
\| \vv \|  := \sqrt{\scp{\vv}{\vv}} \,.
$$

- Two vectors $\vv,\ww \in V$ are **orthogonal** if 
$$
\scp{\vv}{\ww} = 0 \,.
$$


:::


::: Example

Let $V = \R^n$ and consider the euclidean scalar product
$$
\vv \cdot \ww = \sum_{i=1}^n v_i w_i \,,
$$
where $\vv = (v_1,\ldots,v_n)$, $\ww = (w_1,\ldots,w_n)$. Then 
$$
\scp{\vv}{\ww} := \vv \cdot \ww
$$
is an inner product on $\R^n$.

:::


::: Proposition 

Let $V$ be a vector space and $\scp{\cdot}{\cdot}$ an inner product on $V$. There exists an **orthonormal** basis $\{\vv_1, \ldots, \vv_n\}$ of $V$, that is, such that 
$$
\scp{\vv_i}{\vv_j} = 
\begin{cases}
1 & \mbox{ if } \, i = j  \\
0 & \mbox{ if } \, i \neq j  \\
\end{cases}
$$
In particular, the matrix $M$ associated to $\scp{\cdot}{\cdot}$ is the identity.

:::



::: Definition
### Linear map

Let $V,W$ be vector spaces and $L \colon V \to W$. We say that $L$ is **linear** if 
$$
L(\lambda \vv + \mu \ww) = \lambda L(\vv) + \mu L(\ww) 
$$
for all $\vv,\ww \in V$ and $\lambda,\mu \in \R$. 
:::




::: Remark
### Matrix representation of linear maps


Let $V,W$ be vector spaces and $L \colon V \to W$ be a linear map.
Let $\{\vv_1, \ldots, \vv_n\}$ be a basis of $V$ and 
$\{ {\ww}_1 , \ldots, \ww_m\}$ be a basis of $W$. Then there exists a 
matrix $M \in \R^{m \times n}$ such that
$$
L \vv = M \xx \,, \quad \forall \, \vv \in V \,. 
$$
Specifically, $M \in \R^{n \times n}$ is called the matrix associated to 
$L$ with respect to the basis $\{\vv_1,\ldots,\vv_n\}$ of $V$ and $\{\ww_1 \ldots,\ww_m\}$ of $W$, and is defined by 
$$
M := \left(  
\begin{array}{ccc}
a_{11} & \ldots & a_{1n} \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
a_{m1} & \ldots & a_{mn}
\end{array}
\right) \,,
$$
where the coefficients $a_{ij}$ are such that 
$$
L(\vv_j) = a_{1j} \ww_1 + \ldots + a_{mj} \ww_m = \sum_{i=1}^m a_{ij} \ww_i  \,.
$$
In other words, the columns of $M$ are given by the coordinates of the vectors $L(\vv_i)$ with respect to the basis $\{ \ww_1 , \ldots, \ww_m \}$.


:::






::: Definition
### Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

Let $V$ be a vector space and $L \colon V \to V$ a linear map.
We say that $\lambda \in \R$ is an eigenvalue of $L$ if
$$
L(\vv) = \lambda \vv 
$$
for some $\vv \in V$ with $\vv \neq 0$. Such $\vv$ is called **eigenvector** of $L$ associated to the eigenvalue $\lambda$.

:::




::: Definition
### Self-adjoint map

Let $V$ be a vector space, $\scp{\cdot}{\cdot}$ an inner product and $L \colon V \to V$ a linear map. We say that $L$ is **self-adjoint** if
$$
\scp{\vv}{L(\ww)} = \scp{L(\vv)}{\ww} \,, \quad \forall \, \vv , \, \ww \in V \,.
$$

:::






::: Theorem
### Spectral Theorem   {#theorem-spectral}

Let $V$ be a vector space, $\scp{\cdot}{\cdot}$ an inner product, and $L \colon V \to V$ a self-adjoint linear map. There exist an orthonormal 
basis of $V$
$$
\{ \vv_1, \ldots, \vv_n \} \,,
$$
where $\vv_i$ are eigenvectors of $L$, that is,
$$
L \vv_i = \lambda_i \vv_i
$$
for some eigevalue $\lambda_i \in \R$. In particular, the matrix of 
$L$ with respect to the basis $\{\vv_1,\ldots,\vv_n\}$ is diagonal:
$$
M = \operatorname{diag} (\lambda_1,\ldots, \lambda_n)  = 
\left(  
\begin{array}{cccc}
\lambda_1 &  0         & \ldots & 0 \\
    0     &  \lambda_2 & \ldots & 0 \\
  \vdots     &  \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
  0     &  0 & \ldots & \lambda_n \\
\end{array}
\right) \,.
$$


:::



There is also a matrix version of the spectral theorem. To state it,
we need to introduce some terminology.


::: Definition

Let $A \in \R^{n \times n}$ be a matrix. We say that:

- $A$ is **symmetric** if 
$$
A^T = A \,.
$$

- $A$ is **orthogonal** if 
$$
A^T A = I  \,,
$$
where $I$ is the identity matrix.

:::



::: {.Remark  #remark-self-adoint}

Let $L \colon V \to V$ be linear and $A \in \R^{n \times n}$ be the matrix
associated to $L$ with respect to any basis $\{\vv_1,\ldots,\vv_n\}$ of
$V$. They are equivalent:

- $L$ is self-adjoint,
- $A$ is symmetric.

:::




::: Definition
### Matrix eigenvalues

Let $A \in \R^{n \times n}$ be a matrix. An **eigenvalue** of $A$ is a number $\lambda \in \R$ such that 
$$
A \vv = \lambda \vv \,,
$$
for some $\vv \in \R^n$ with $\vv \neq 0$. The vector $\vv$ is called an **eigenvector** of $A$ with eigenvalue $\lambda$.

:::




::: Remark

Let $A \in \R^{n \times n}$. The eigenvalues of $\lambda$ of $A$ can be computed by
solving the **characteristic equation**
$$
P(\lambda) = 0 \,,
$$
where $P$ is the **characteristic polynomial** of $A$, defined by
$$
P(\lambda) := \det ( A - \lambda I  ) \,.
$$

:::



::: Remark 

Let $L \colon V \to V$ be a linear map and $A$ the associated matrix 
with respect to any basis of $V$. Then
$$
L(\vv) = A \xx \,, \quad \, \forall \, \vv \in V\,,
$$
where $\xx \in \R^n$ is the vector of coordinates of $\vv$.
They are equivalent:

- $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $L$ of eigenvector $\vv$,
- $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A$ of eigenvector $\xx$.

:::




::: Theorem
### Spectral Theorem for matrices {#theorem-spectral-matrix}

Let $A \in \R^{n \times n}$ be a symmetric matrix. Consider $\R^n$ equipped with the euclidean scalar product. There exist an orthonormal 
basis of $V$
$$
\{ \vv_1, \ldots, \vv_n \} \,,
$$
where $\vv_i$ are eigenvectors of $A$, that is,
$$
A \vv_i = \lambda_i \vv_i
$$
for some eigevalue $\lambda_i \in \R$. Moreover
$$
A = P D P^T \,,
$$
where
\begin{align*}
P & := \left( \vv_1 \vert \ldots \vert \vv_n \right) \\
D & := \operatorname{diag} (\lambda_1,\ldots, \lambda_n)  = 
\left(  
\begin{array}{cccc}
\lambda_1 &  0         & \ldots & 0 \\
    0     &  \lambda_1 & \ldots & 0 \\
  \vdots     &  \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
  0     &  0 & \ldots & \lambda_n \\
\end{array}
\right) \,.
\end{align*}


:::



::: Remark

The corresponedence between Theorem \ref{theorem-spectral} and Theorem
\ref{theorem-spectral-matrix} is as follows. Let $A \in \R^{n \times n}$ be symmetric and $\{\ww_1, \ldots, \ww_n\}$ be any orthonormal basis
of the vector space $V$. Define the linear map $L \colon V \to V$
such that
$$
L(\vv_j) =  \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ij} \ww_i  \,, \quad \forall \, j =1 , \ldots , n \, .
$$
In this way $A$ is the matrix associated to $L$ with respect to the 
basis $\{\ww_1, \ldots, \ww_n\}$. Then 
$L$ is self-adjoint. Moreover $L$ and $A$ have the same eigenvalues. 
By the Spectral Theorem there exists an orthonormal basis $\{\vv_1,\ldots, \vv_n\}$ of $V$ such that the matrix of $L$ with respect to such basis, say $D$, is
diagonal. Then 
$$
A = P D P^T 
$$
where $P$ is the matrix of change of basis between $\{\ww_1, \ldots, \ww_n\}$
and $\{\vv_1, \ldots, \vv_n\}$, that is, $P = (p_{ij})$ where
$$
\ww_j = \sum_{i=1}^n p_{ij} \vv_i \,.
$$

### Topology of $\R^n$

::: Definition 
### Topology of $\R^n$

The Euclidean norm on $\R^n$ is denoted by 
$$
\| \xx \| := \sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 }\,, \quad \xx = (x_1 , \ldots, x_n) \in \R^n \,.
$$
The Euclidean norm induces the distance
$$
d(\xx,\yy) := \| \xx - \yy \| =   \sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - y_i)^2 } \,.
$$

In particular, we have:

1. The pair $(\R^n,d)$ is a metric space. 
2. The topology induced by the metric $d$ is called the Euclidean topology, denoted by $\TT$. 
3. A set $U \subseteq \R^n$ is **open** if for all $\xx \in U$ there exists $\e>0$ such that $B_{\e}(\xx) \subseteq U$, where
$$
B_{\e}(\xx) := \{  \yy \in \R^n \divider \| \xx - \yy  \| < \e   \}
$$
is the open ball of radius $\e>0$ and centered at $\xx$. In this case we write $U \in \TT$, with $\TT$ the Euclidean topology in $\R^n$.

4. A set $V \subseteq \R^n$ is **closed** if $V^c := \R^n \smallsetminus U$ is open. 

:::



::: Example

- The $n$-dimensional unit sphere
$$
\sphere^n = \{ \xx \in \R^{n+1} \divider \| \xx \| = 1 \}
$$
is closed in $\R^{n+1}$. Indeed, define $f \colon \R^n \to \R$ by 
$$
f(\xx) = \| \xx \| \,.
$$
Then $f$ is continuous and 
$$
\sphere^n = f^{-1}(\{1\}) \,.
$$
Since $\{1\}$ is closed in $\R$, and $f$ is continuous, we conclude that $\sphere^n$ is closed.

 
- The $n$-dimensional unit cube 
$$
C := \{ \xx \in \R^n \divider |x_1| + \ldots + |x_n| <1  \}
$$
is open in $\R^n$. Indeed, define $f \colon \R^n \to \R$ by 
$$
f(\xx) = |x_1| + \ldots + |x_n| \,.
$$
Then $f$ is continuous and 
$$
C = f^{-1}((-\infty,1)) \,.
$$
Since $(-\infty,1)$ is open in $\R$, and $f$ is continuous, we conclude that $C$ is open.

- The set 
$$
V := \{ \xx \in \R^n \divider |x_1| + \ldots + |x_n| \geq 1  \}
$$
is closed, since $V^c = C$ is the unit cube, which is open.

:::



::: Definition 
### Subspace Topology

Given a subset $A \subseteq \R^n$ the **subspace topology** on $A$ is the family of sets
$$
\TT_A := \{  U \subseteq A \divider \exists \,\, W \in \TT \st U = A \cap W  \} \,.
$$
If $U \in \TT_A$, we say that $U$ is open in $A$.

:::





### Smooth functions


We recall some basic facts about smooth functions from $\R^n$ into $\R^m$. For a vector valued function $f \colon \R^n \to \R^m$ we denote its components by 
$$
f = (f_1,\ldots,f_m) \,.
$$


::: Definition
### Continuous Function

Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to \R^m$ with $U$ open. We say that $f$ is **continuous** at $\xx \in U$ if $\forall \, \e>0$,  $\exists \, \delta > 0$ such that 
$$
\|  \xx - \yy  \| < \delta \quad \implies \quad 
\| f(\xx) - f (\yy) \| < \e \,.
$$
We say that $f$ is continuous in $U$ if it is continuous for all $\xx \in U$.
:::

The above ``classical'' definition of continuity is equivalent to the topological one, in the following sense:

::: Proposition
### Continuity: Topological definition

Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to V \subseteq \R^m$, with $U,V$ open. We have that $f$ is continuous if and only if $f^{-1}(A)$ is open in $U$, for all $A$ open in $V$.

:::


::: Definition
### Homeomorphism

Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to V \subseteq \R^m$ with $U,V$ open. We say that $f$ is a **homeomorphism** if: 

1. $f$ is continuous; 
2. There exists inverse $f^{-1} \colon V \to U$ which is continuous.

:::



::: Definition
### Differentiable Function

Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to \R^m$ with $U$ open. We say that $f$ is **differentiable** at $\xx \in U$ if there exists a linear map $d_{\xx} f \colon \R^n \to \R^m$ such that
$$
d_{\xx}f (\mathbf{h}) = \lim_{\e \to 0} \   \frac{ f(\xx + \e \mathbf{h} )  - f(\xx)  }{ \e } \,,
$$
for all $\mathbf{h} \in \R^n$, where the limit is taken in $\R^m$. The linear map $d_{\xx} f$ is called the **differential** of $f$ at $\xx$. 

:::


The idea behind the definition of differentiability is as follows: The function $f$ is differentiable at $\xx$ if it can be approximated by the linear map $d_{\xx} f$ around the point $\xx$.  

We denote by $\{\ee_i\}_{i=1}^n$ the standard basis of $\R^n$. When $f$ is differentiable, the partial derivatives are defined as follows:

::: Definition
### Partial Derivative

Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to \R^m$ with $U$ open be differentiable. The **partial derivative** of $f$ at $\xx \in U$ in direction $\ee_i$ is given by
$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(\xx) := d_{\xx} f (\ee_i) =  \lim_{\e \to 0}  \frac{ f( \xx + \e \ee_i ) - f(\xx) }{ \e } \,.
$$

:::



::: Definition
### Jacobian Matrix

Let $f \colon U \subset \R^n \to \R^m$ be differentiable. The **Jacobian** of 
$f$ at $\xx$ is the $m \times n$ matrix of partial derivatives:
$$
Jf(\xx):= \left( \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}(\xx) \right)_{i,j}  \in \R^{m \times n} \,.
$$
If $m=n$ then $Jf \in \R^{n \times n}$ is a square matrix and we can compute its determinant, denoted by
$$
\det (Jf) \,.
$$

:::

The differential $d_{\xx} f \colon \R^n \to \R^m$ is a linear map. As such, it must have a matrix representation with respect to the Euclidean basis. Since the partial derivative is defined as 
$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(\xx):= d_{\xx} f(\ee_i) \,,
$$
we trivially have that $Jf(\xx)$ is the matrix of $d_{\xx} f$ with respect to the standard basis:



::: Proposition
### Matrix representation of the differential

Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to \R^m$ be differentiable. The matrix of the linear map $d_{\xx} f \colon \R^n \to \R^m$ with respect to the standard basis is given by the Jacobian matrix $Jf(\xx)$.

:::



::: Definition
### Multi-index notation

For a multi-index
$$
\alpha := (\alpha_1, \ldots , \alpha_n) \in \N^n
$$
we denote by 
$$
|\alpha|:= \sum_{i=1}^n   |\alpha_i|
$$
the length of the multi-index. 

:::




::: Definition
### Smooth Function

Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to \R^m$ with $U$ open. We say that $f$ is smooth if the derivatives 
$$
\frac{\partial^{|\alpha|} f}{d\xx^\alpha} :=  \frac{\partial^{\alpha_1}}{ \partial x_1^{\alpha_1}} \cdots \frac{\partial^{\alpha_n}}{ \partial x_n^{\alpha_n}} \, f
$$
exist for each multi-index $\alpha \in \N^n$. Note that in this case all the derivatives of $f$ are automatically continuous.

:::




::: Notation
### Gradient and partial derivatives

Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to \R$ be smooth. We denote the partial derivatives by 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\partial_{x_i} f & = f_{x_i} =  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} \\
\partial_{x_i x_j} f & = f_{x_i x_j} = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} \\
\partial_{x_i x_j x_k} f & = f_{x_i x_j x_k} =  \frac{\partial^3 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j \partial x_k} 
\end{aligned}
$$

For $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to \R$ smooth we denote the **gradient** by
$$
\nabla f (\xx) = \left(  f_{x_1}(\xx) , \ldots ,  f_{x_n}(\xx) \right) \,.
$$
Note that $\nabla f(\xx)$ coincides with $Jf(\xx)$.


:::



::: Example

The functions $f \colon \R^2 \to \R$ and $g \colon \R^2 \to \R^3$ defined by
$$
f(x,y) := \cos(x)y \,, \quad 
g(x,y) := (x^2,y^2,x-y)
$$
are both smooth.

### Diffeomorphisms


A key definition needed for the study of surfaces is the one of diffeomorphism. In this section we only consider maps from $\R^n$ into $\R^n$.


::: Definition
### Diffeomorphism
  
Let $f \colon U \to V$, with $U,V \subseteq \R^n$ open. We say that $f$ is a **diffeomorphism** between $U$ and $V$ if:

1. $f$ is smooth,
2. There exists the inverse $f^{-1} \colon V \to U$, 
3. $f^{-1}$ is smooth.

:::


::: Definition
### Local diffeomorphism

Let $f \colon \R^n \to \R^n$. We say that $f$ is a **local diffeomorphism** at 
$\xx_0 \in \R^n$ if:

1. There exists an open set $U \subseteq \R^n$ such that $\xx_0 \in U$,
2. There exists an open set $V \subseteq \R^n$ such that $f(\xx_0) \in V$,
3. $f \colon U \to V$ is a diffeomorphism.

:::


::: Remark

If $f \colon U \to V$ is a diffeomorphism, then $f$ is a local diffeomorphism at each $\xx_0 \in U$.

:::


Non-vanishing Jacobian determinant is a necessary condition for being a diffeomorphism, as outlined in the following Proposition.


::: {.Proposition #proposition-jacobian-zero}

Let $f \colon U \to \R^n$ with $U \subseteq \R^n$ open. Suppose $f$ is a local diffeomorhism at $\xx_0 \in U$. Then 
$$
\det Jf (\xx_0) \neq 0 \,.
$${#eq-non-vanish-det}

:::



::: Example

We have already encountered Proposition \ref{proposition-jacobian-zero} in the scalar case when we were studying curves. Indeed, suppose that 
$$
\f \colon \R \to \R
$$
is a local diffeomorphism at $t_0 \in \R$. Then
$$
J\phi(t_0) = \dot{\phi}(t_0) \,, \quad \det J\phi(t_0) = \dot{\f}(t_0) \,,
$$
and we recover the already seen result that
$$
\dot{\f}(t_0) \neq 0 \,.
$$

:::


The condition at (@eq-non-vanish-det) is sufficient fot $f$ to be a **local diffeomorphism** at $\xx_0$. This is the content of the Inverse Function Theorem.



::: Theorem
### Inverse Function Theorem {#theorem-inverse-function}

Let $f \colon U \to \R^n$ with $U \subseteq \R^n$ open. Suppose $f$ is a smooth function and
$$
\det J f(\xx_0) \neq 0 \,,
$$
for some $\xx_0 \in U$. Then:

1. There exists an open set $U_0 \subseteq U$ such that $\xx_0 \in U_0$,
2. There exists an open set $V$ such that $f(\xx_0) \in V$,
3. $f \colon U_0 \to V$ is a diffeomorphism.


:::




::: Example

Define $f \colon \R^2 \to \R^2$ by
$$
f(x,y) := (\cos(x) \sin(y), \sin(x) \sin(y)) \,.
$$
Then 
$$
J f (x,y) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
 - \sin(x) \sin(y)  &   \cos(x) \cos(y) \\
 \cos(x) \sin(y)    &   \sin(x) \cos(y)
\end{array}
\right) \,,
$$
and 
\begin{align*}
\det Jf(x,y) & = - \sin^2(x) \cos(y) \sin(y) - \cos^2(x) \cos(y) \sin(y) \\
             & = - \sin(y) \cos(y) \\
             & = - \frac{1}{2} \sin(2y) \,.
\end{align*}
Therefore 
$$
\det Jf(x,y) = 0 \quad \iff \quad 
y = \frac{k \pi}{2} \,, \,\, k \in \N \,.
$$
The above condition means that the Jacobian vanishes on each of the lines
$$
L_k := \left\{ \left(x, \frac{k \pi}{2} \right) \divider x \in \R \right\} \,.
$$
Define the open set $U$ obtained by removing the lines $L_k$ from $\R^n$, that is, 
$$
U:= \R^n \smallsetminus \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty L_k \,.
$$
In particular, we have
$$
\det Jf(x,y) \neq 0 \,, \quad \forall \, (x,y) \in U \,.
$$
By the Inverse Function Theorem \ref{theorem-inverse-function}, $f$ is a local diffeomorphism at each point $(x,y) \in U$.

:::




::: Warning 

Condition (@eq-non-vanish-det) is **not sufficient** for $f$ to be a global diffeomorphism, in the following sense: There exist differentiable functions $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to \R^n$ such that:

1. $\det J f(\xx) \neq 0$ for all $\xx \in U$,
2. $f$ is not a diffeomorphism between $U$ and $f(U)$.

We will show this in the next Example.

:::


::: Example

**Question.** Consider the function $f \colon \R^2 \to \R^2$ defined by
$$
f(x,y) = (e^x \cos(y), e^x \sin(y)) \,.
$$

1. Prove that $f$ is a local diffeomorphism at each point $(x,y) \in \R^2$.

2. Prove that $f$ is not a diffeomorphism.


**Solution.** 

1. We compute
\begin{align*}
& J f (x,y) = 
e^x \left(
\begin{array}{cc}
  \cos(y)  &    \sin(y) \\
  -\sin(y)    &  \cos(y) 
\end{array}
\right)  \\
& \det Jf(x,y) = e^{2x} 
\end{align*}
Therefore 
$$
Jf(x,y) \neq 0 \quad \forall \, (x,y) \in \R^2 \,.
$$
By the Inverse Function Theorem, $f$ is a local diffeomorphism at each point $(x,y) \in \R^2$. 

2. $f$ is not injective, since 
$$
f(x,y) = f(x, y + 2n\pi) \,, \quad \forall\, (x,y) \in \R^2 , \,  n \in \N  \,.
$$
Therefore $f$ is not invertible from $\R^2$ into $\R^2$. This implies $f$ cannot be a diffeomorphism of $\R^2$ into $\R^2$.

## Surfaces


We give our main definition of surface in $\R^3$.


::: Definition
### Surface

Let $\SSS \subseteq \R^3$ be a connected set. We say that $\SSS$ is a **surface** if for every point $\pp \in \SSS$ there exist 

1. An open set $U \subseteq \R^2$,
2. A smooth map
$$
\sss \colon U \to  \sss(U) \subseteq \SSS \,
$$
such that 
    - $\pp \in \sss(U)$
    - $\sss(U)$ is open in $\SSS$
    - $\sss$ is a homeomorphism between $U$ and $\sss(U)$

The homeomorphism $\sss$ is called a **surface chart** at $\pp$.

:::


A visual interpretation of the definition of surface is given in @fig-def-surface.



::: Remark


1. $\SSS$ is a topological space with the subspace topology induced by the inclusion $\SSS \subseteq \R^3$. This means that a subset $V \subseteq \SSS$ is open in $\SSS$, if there exists an open set $W \subseteq \R^3$ such that
$$
V = W \cap \SSS \,.
$$

2. $\SSS$ is required to be **connected** with respect to the subspace topology.


3. A surface chart $\sss$ is a map 
$$
\sss \colon U  \to \R^3 \,,
$$
with $U \subseteq \R^2$ open.
Therefore smoothness of $\sss$ is intended in the classical sense.


4. Given a chart $\sss \colon U \to \sss(U)$, the set $U$ is open in $\R^2$ while $\sss(U)$ is open in $\SSS$ with the subspace topology. This means there exists and open set $W \subseteq \R^3$ such that
$$
\sss(U) = W \cap \SSS \,.
$$


5. The homeomorphism condition is saying that the surface patch
$$
\sss(U) \subseteq \SSS
$$ 
can be continuously deformed into the open set 
$$
U \subseteq \R^2 \,.
$$

An atlas of a surface is a collection of charts which cover the whole surface:


::: Definition
### Atlas of a surface

Let $\SSS$ be a surface. Assume there exists a collection of **charts** 
$$
\mathcal{A} = \{ \sss_i\}_{i \in I} \,, \qquad 
\sss_i  \colon U_i \to \sss(U_i) \subseteq \SSS \,,
$$
for some family of indices $I$. The family $\mathcal{A}$ is an **atlas** of $\SSS$ if 
$$
\SSS = \bigcup_{i \in I} \sss_i(U_i)  \,.
$$

:::





::: Example
### 2D Plane in $\R^3$

Planes in $\R^3$ are surfaces with atlas made by one chart. To prove it, note that a plane $\p \subseteq \R^3$ is described by the equation
$$
\p  = \{  \xx  \in \R^3 \divider \xx \cdot \ww = \lambda \} \,,
$$
for some $\ww \in \R^3$ and $\lambda \in \R$. Let

- $\pp,\mathbf{q} \in \R^3$ be orthonormal, and orthogonal to $\ww$.
- $\mathbf{a} \in \p$ be any point in the plane.

This construction is represented in @fig-plane-surface. Let $\xx \in \p$. Then $\xx-\mathbf{a}$ satisfies
$$
 (\xx - \mathbf{a}) \cdot \ww  = 0 \,.
$$
Hence, the vector $\xx - \mathbf{a}$ is orthogonal to $\ww$, meaning it can be written as linear combination of the vectors $\pp$ and $\mathbf{q}$: 
$$
\xx - \mathbf{a} = u \pp + v \mathbf{q} \,,
$$
for some coefficients $u,v \in \R$. Therefore the plane $\p$ can be
equivalently represented as
$$
\p = \{ \mathbf{a} + u \pp + v \mathbf{q} \divider u,v \in \R \} \,.
$$
The above suggests to define the chart $\sss \colon \R^2 \to \p$ by
$$
\sss(u,v):= \mathbf{a} + u \pp + v \mathbf{q} \,.
$$
Then $\sss$ is a chart for $\p$, and 
$$
\mathcal{A} = \{\sss\}
$$ 
is an atlas, implying that $\p$ is a surface.

> Check that $\sss$ is a chart:
>
- $\sss$ is smooth.
- $\R^2$ is obviously open.
- $\sss(\R^2)$ is open in $\p$ for the subspace topology, since $\sss(\R^2) = \p$, and $\p$ is open in the subspace topology.
- Suppose $\xx = \sss(u,v)$. Then
$$
(\xx - \mathbf{a}) \cdot \pp =  u \,, \quad 
(\xx - \mathbf{a}) \cdot \mathbf{q} =  v \,,
$$
given that $\pp$ and $\mathbf{q}$ are orthonormal.
- The above shows that the inverse of $\sss$ is $\sss^{-1} \colon \p \to \R^2$ given by
$$
\sss^{-1} (\xx) = ( (\xx - \mathbf{a}) \cdot \pp , (\xx - \mathbf{a}) \cdot \mathbf{q}  ) \,.
$$
Clearly, $\sss^{-1}$ is continuous.
- Thus, $\sss$ is a homeomorphism between $\R^2$ and $\p$. 
- Therefore $\sss$ is a chart for $\p$. Since

Notice that 
$$
\sss(\R^2) = \p \,,
$$ 
and therefore $\mathcal{A} = \{\sss\}$ is an atlas for $\p$, showing that $\p$ is a surface.

### Unit cylinder {#example-cylinder-chart}

Consider the infinite unit cylinder
$$
\SSS  = \{  (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider x^2 + y^2 = 1 \} \,.
$$
Define the map 
$$
\sss \colon \R^2 \to \R^3   \,, \quad 
\sss(u,v):= (\cos(u),\sin(u),v) \,.
$$
Setting $V := [0,2\pi) \times \R$, we notice that
$$
\sss(V) = \SSS \,.
$$
Moreover $\sss \colon V \to \SSS$ is clearly bijective, with inverse
$$
\sss^{-1}(x,y,z) = (\theta,z) \,,  
$$
with $\theta$ the angle formed by the vector $\pp = (x,y)$ with the $x$-axis.
However, $V$ is not open in $\R^2$, and therefore $\sss$ cannot be a chart. To overcome this issue, let us cover $V$ with two open sets: For example,
$$
U_1 := \left( 0,\frac{ 3 \pi}{2} \right) \times \R \,, \quad \left( \pi,\frac{ 5 \pi}{2} \right) \times \R \,,
$$
so that 
$$
V = U_1 \cup U_2 \,,
$$
with $U_1$ and $U_2$ open. We can now define two charts
$$
\sss_1 \colon U_1 \to \SSS\,, \quad \sss_2 \colon U_2 \to \SSS \,,
$$
by restricting $\sss$:
$$
\sss_1 := \sss |_{U_1} \,,   \quad  \sss_2 := \sss |_{U_2} \,.
$$
The images of the two charts $\sss_1$ and $\sss_2$ are shown in @fig-cylinder-surface. We have that $\SSS$ is a surface with the atlas
$$
\mathcal{A} = \{ \sss_1, \sss_2\} \,.

Let us conclude the section with an example of a set which is not 
a surface.



::: Example
### Circular cone

Consider the circular cone
$$
\SSS := \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider x^2 + y^2 = z^2  \} \,.
$$
Then $\SSS$ is not a surface. This is, essentially, a consequence of
the fact that
$$
\SSS \smallsetminus \{\zero\}
$$
is a disconnected set, see @fig-surface-cone.


To see that $\SSS$ is not a surface, suppose there exists an 
atlas $\{\sss_i\}$ of $\SSS$
$$
\sss_i \colon U_i \to \sss_i(U_i) \subseteq \SSS \,.
$$
In particular there exists a chart $\sss$ such that 
$$
\zero \in \sss (U) \,.
$$
Let $\xx_0 \in U$ be the point such that
$$
\sss (\xx_0) = \zero \,.
$$
Since $U$ is open in $\R^2$, there exists $\e>0$ such that $B_{\e}(\xx_0) \subseteq U$. Since $\sss$ is a homeomorphism, we deduce that
$$
\sss (B_{\e}(\xx_0))
$$
is open in $\SSS$. Hence there exists an open set $W$ in $\R^3$ such that
$$
\sss(B_{\e}(\xx_0)) = \sss(U) \cap W \,.
$$
As $\zero \in \sss (B_{\e}(\xx_0))$, we conclude that $\zero \in W$. Since $W$ is open in $\R^3$, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that
$$
B_{\delta} (\zero) \subseteq W \,.
$$
In particular, we deduce that
$$
\sss(U) \cap B_{\delta} (\zero) \subseteq \sss(U) \cap W =  \sss(B_{\e}(\xx_0)) \,.
$$
The ball $B_{\delta} (\zero)$ intersects both $\SSS^-$ and $\SSS^+$, with
$$
\SSS^- := \SSS \cap \{ z < 0 \}   \,, \quad
\SSS^+ := \SSS \cap \{ z > 0 \}   \,.
$$
Therefore $\sss(B_{\e}(\xx_0))$ intersects both $\SSS^-$ and $\SSS^+$. This implies that the set
$$
V := \sss (B_{\e}(\xx_0)) \smallsetminus \{\zero\}
$$
is disconnected, with disconnection given by
$$
V = ( V \cap \SSS^- ) \cup (V \cap \SSS^+) \,.
$$
However, $V$ is homeomorphic to 
$$
B_{\e} (\xx_0) \smallsetminus \{ \xx_0 \} \,,
$$
which is instead connected. We have obtained a contradiction, and therefore $\SSS$ is not a surface.

## Regular Surfaces


We have defined a regular curve to be a map $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^n$ such that
$$
\norm{\dg(t)} \neq 0 \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
Regularity allowed us to reparametrize by arc-length and define the Frenet frame, curvature and torsion. We then proved that curvature and torsion completely characterize $\g$, up to rigid motions.

We want to do something similar for surfaces: We look for a condition that eventually will allow us to define the tangent plane to the surface. Specifically, we require that the partial derivatives $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ of a chart $\sss$ are linearly independent. In this case $\sss$ is called a regular chart. In details: 

::: Definition
### Regular Chart

Let $U \subseteq \R^2$ be open. A map
$$
\sss = \sss(u,v)  \colon U \to \R^3
$$
is called a **regular chart** if the partial derivatives
$$
\sss_u(u,v) = \frac{d\sss}{du}(u,v) \,, \quad
\sss_v(u,v) = \frac{d\sss}{dv}(u,v) 
$$
are linearly independent vectors of $\R^3$ for all $(u,v) \in U$.
:::

We are now ready to define regular surfaces.


::: Definition
### Regular surface

Let $\SSS$ be a surface. We say that:

- $\mathcal{A}$ is a **regular atlas** if $\sss$ is a regular chart for all $\sss \in \mathcal{A}$. 
- $\SSS$ is a **regular surface** if there exists a regular atlas for $\SSS$.

:::

Before making some examples, we highlight give some equivalent methods for checking the regularity condition.

::: Proposition

Let $U \subseteq \R^2$ be open and consider a map
$$
\sss  \colon U \to \R^3 \,.
$$
They are equivalent:

1. $\sss$ is a regular chart.
2. The differential $d_{\xx} \sss \colon \R^2 \to \R^3$ is injective for all $\xx \in U$.
3. The Jacobian matrix
$$
J\sss (u,v) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\sigma^1_{u}  &  \sigma^1_{v} \\
\sigma^2_{u}  &  \sigma^2_{v} \\
\sigma^3_{u}  &  \sigma^3_{v} \\
\end{array} 
\right)
$$
has rank $2$ for all $(u,v) \in U$.
4. It holds
$$
\sss_u \times \sss_v \neq 0 \, \quad  \forall \, (u,v) \in U \,.
$$


:::


::: Proof

*Part 1. Equivalence of Point 1 and Point 4.* 

By the properties of vector product, we have that
$$
\sss_u \times \sss_v \neq 0 \, \quad \, \forall \, (u,v) \in U 
$$
if and only if $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ are linearly independent for all $(u,v) \in U$.


*Part 2. Equivalence of Point 2 and Point 3.* 

The differential $d_{\xx}\sss \colon \R^2 \to \R^3$ is represented in matrix form by the Jacobian
$$
J\sss (u,v) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\sigma^1_{u}  &  \sigma^1_{v} \\
\sigma^2_{u}  &  \sigma^2_{v} \\
\sigma^3_{u}  &  \sigma^3_{v} \\
\end{array} 
\right) \,.
$$
By standard linear algebra results, $J\sss$ has rank 2 if and only if $d\sss$ is injective. 

*Part 3. Equivalence of Point 1 and Point 3.*

A $3 \times 2$ matrix has rank 2 if and only if its columns are linearly independent. Since the columns of $J\sss$ are $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$, we 
conclude that $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ are linearly independent.

### 2D Plane in $\R^3$

**Question.** Let $\mathbf{a}, \pp, \mathbf{q} \in \R^3$, with $\pp$ and $\mathbf{q}$ orthonormal. The plane

is a surface with atlas $\mathcal{A} = \{\sss\}$, where
$$
\sss \colon \R^2 \to \p \,, \quad \sss(u,v):= \mathbf{a} + u \pp + v \mathbf{q} \,.
$$
Prove that $\p$ is a regular surface.

**Solution.** $\p$ is a regular surface because $\sss$ is a regular chart. To see it, compute
$$
\sss_u = \pp  \,, \quad \sss_v = \mathbf{q} \,,
$$
showing that $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ are linearly independent, given that $\pp$ and $\mathbf{q}$ are orthonormal.

Consider the infinite unit cylinder

$$
\mathcal{A} = \{ \sss_1,\sss_2\} \,,
$$ 
where we define
$$
\sss \colon \R^2 \to \R^3   \,, \quad 
\sss(u,v):= (\cos(u),\sin(u),v)
$$
and 
\begin{align*}
\sss_1 & := \sss |_{U_1} \,,   & \sss_2 & := \sss |_{U_2} \,, \\
U_1 & := \left( 0,\frac{ 3 \pi}{2} \right) \times \R \,, 
& U_2 & := \left( \pi,\frac{ 5 \pi}{2} \right) \times \R \,.
\end{align*}
$\SSS$ is a regular surface because $\mathcal{A}$ is a regular atlas.

> To see it, compute the partial derivatives
$$
\sss_u = (-\sin(u),\cos(u),0) \,, \quad 
\sss_v = (0,0,1) \,.
$$
Therefore
$$
\sss_u \times \sss_v = (\cos (u), \sin(u), 0)  \,, \quad \norm{\sss_u \times \sss_v} = 1 \,.
$$
This implies
$$
\sss_u \times \sss_v \neq 0 \,, \quad \forall \, (u,v) \in \R^2 \,,
$$
showing that $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ are linearly independent. Therefore
$\sss_1$ and $\sss_2$ are regular charts, being restrictions of $\sss$.

:::



The infinite cylinder can also be parametrized using a single chart, as shown in the next Example.


::: Example
### Unit cylinder: Single chart atlas {#example-cylinder-single}

Consider again infinite unit cylinder
$$
\SSS  = \{  (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider x^2 + y^2 = 1 \} \,.
$$
Define the open set 
$$
U := \R^2 \smallsetminus \{(0,0)\} \,,
$$
and the map $\sss \colon U \to \SSS$ by
$$
\sss (u,v) = \left(  \frac{u}{\sqrt{u^2+v^2}}, \frac{v}{\sqrt{u^2+v^2}} , \log \left( \sqrt{u^2+v^2} \right)    \right) \,.
$$
Then $\sss$ is regular and $\mathcal{A} = \{\sss\}$ is a regular atlas for $\SSS$.


> Proof: Left as an exercise.

:::



::: Example
### Graph of a function

Let $U \subseteq \R^2$ be open and $f \colon U \to \R$ be smooth. The graph of $f$ is the set
$$
\Gamma_f := \{ (u,v,f(u,v)) \divider (u,v) \in U  \}  \,.
$$
We have seen that $\Gamma_f$ is surface with atlas given by
$\mathcal{A} = \{ \sss \}$, where
$$
\sss \colon U \to \Gamma_f \,, \quad 
\sss(u,v):=(u,v,f(u,v)) \,.
$$
We have that $\Gamma_f$ is a regular surface, since $\mathcal{A}$ is a regular atlas.

> Compute the partial derivatives
$$
\sss_u = (1,0,f_u) \,, \quad 
\sss_v = (0,1,f_v) \,.
$$
Therefore, the Jacobian matrix is
$$
J\sss (u,v) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
1  &  0 \\
0  &  1 \\
f_u  & f_v \\
\end{array} 
\right) \,.
$$
Notice that the first minor of $J\sss$ is the identity matrix, which has determinant $1$, and is hence invertible. Therefore $J\sss$ has rank 2, showing that $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ are linearly independent. Hence $\sss$ is regular.
>
>An alternative way to prove regularity would have been to compute
$$
\sss_u \times \sss_v = (-f_u, - f_v, 1 ) \,.
$$
We observe that $\sss_u \times \sss_v \neq 0$ because the last component never vanishes. Thus, $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ are linearly independent, and $\sss$ is a regular chart.

We now want to consider the sphere 
$$
\sphere^2 := \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \, \colon \, x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1  \} \,.
$$
In order to prove that $\sphere^2$ is a regular surface, we need to introduce spherical coordinates.

::: Definition
### Spherical coordinates

Consider a point
$$
\pp := (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \smallsetminus \{\zero\} \,.
$$ 
The point $\pp$ is represented in **spherical coordinates** by
\begin{align*}
x & = \rho \cos(\theta) \cos (\fi)    \\
y & = \rho \sin(\theta) \cos (\fi)   \\
z & = \rho \sin (\fi) 
\end{align*}
where 
$$
\rho:=\sqrt{ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 } \,, \quad \theta \in [-\pi,\pi] \,, \quad \fi \in \left[ -\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2} \right] \,,
$$
with the angles $\theta$ and $\fi$ as in @fig-spherical-coordinates. 

> It is clear that $z = \rho \sin(\fi)$. To compute $x$ and $y$, we note
that the segment joining $\zero$ to $\mathbf{q}$ has length 
$$
L = \rho \cos(\fi) \,.
$$
Therefore we get

::: Example
### Unit sphere in spherical coordinates {#example-sphere-spherical}

Consider the unit sphere in $\R^3$
$$
\sphere^2 := \{  (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1  \} \,.
$$
Spherical coordinates allow us to define an atlas on $\sphere^2$.
In details, define the set
$$
U := \left\{ (\theta,\fi)  \in \R^2 \divider \theta \in ( -\pi,\pi), \, \fi \in \left(  -\frac{\pi}{2} , \frac{\pi}{2} \right)  \right\} \,,
$$
and the map $\sss \colon U \to \R^3$ by
$$
\sss( \theta , \fi ) :=  ( \cos(\theta) \cos(\fi) , \sin(\theta) \cos(\fi) , \sin (\fi)  ) \,.
$$
In order to name some of the parallels and meridians on $\sphere^2$, let us identify $\sphere^2$ with the Earth. With reference to @fig-earth, we make the following definitions:

- The *Equator Line* corresponds to the angle $\fi = 0$, that is, 
$$
\mbox{Equator Line } =  \sphere^2 \cap \{z = 0 \} \,.
$$

- The *Greenwich meridian* corresponds to the angle $\theta = 0$. Hence:
$$
\mbox{Greenwich } = \left\{ (\cos(\fi) , 0 , \sin (\fi)) \,, \,\, \fi \in   \left(  -\frac{\pi}{2} , \frac{\pi}{2} \right)  \right\} \,.
$$

- The *Date Line* is the meridian opposite to the Greenwich one. This corresponds to $\theta = \pi$, and is parametrized by:
$$
\mbox{Date Line } = \left\{ (- \cos(\fi) , 0 , \sin (\fi)) \,, \,\, \fi \in   \left(  -\frac{\pi}{2} , \frac{\pi}{2} \right)  \right\} \,.
$$

- The *North Pole* and *South Pole* have coordinates
$$
N = (0,0,1) \,, \quad S = (0,0,-1) \,. 
$$

- The *Northern Hemisphere* is the *top-half* of $\sphere^2$, that is, 
$$
\mbox{Northern Hemisphere } = \sphere^2 \cap \{ z \geq 0 \} \,.
$$

- The *Southern Hemisphere* is the *bottom-half* of $\sphere^2$, that is, 
$$
\mbox{Southern Hemisphere } = \sphere^2 \cap \{ z \leq 0 \} \,.
$$


Notice that the angles 
$$
\theta = \pi \,, \quad \fi = \pm \frac{\pi}{2}  
$$
are excluded in the definition of $U$. Therefore the parametrization $\sss$ misses the Date Line, as well as the North and South Poles, see the left picture in @fig-chart-sphere. In formulas:
\begin{align*}
\sss(U) & = \sphere^2 \smallsetminus \{\mbox{Date Line, North Pole, South Pole}\} \\
        & = \sphere^2 \smallsetminus \{ (x,0,z) \in \R^3 \, \colon \, x \leq 0 \} \,.
\end{align*}
Since $\sss(U) \neq \sphere^2$, the chart $\sss$ does not form an atlas. We need a second chart. An option is to define $\widetilde{\sss} \colon U \to \R^3$ by
$$
\widetilde{\sss} := ( - \cos (\theta)\cos(\fi) , -\sin(\fi) , - \sin(\theta) \cos (\fi) ) \,.
$$
Notice that $\widetilde{\sss}$ is obtained by rotating $\sss$ by $\pi$ about the $z$-axis, and by $\pi/2$ about the $y$-axis, see the right picture in @fig-chart-sphere. Thus,
$$
\widetilde{\sss} (U) = \sphere^2 \smallsetminus \{ (x,y,0) \in \R^3 \divider x \geq 0   \} \,.
$$
In particular, we have shown that
$$
\sphere^2 = \sss(U) \cup \widetilde{\sss}(U) \,.
$$
It is left as an exercise to check that
$$
\mathcal{A} := \{   \sss , \widetilde{\sss} \} 
$$
is a regular atlas for $\sphere^2$.

*Solution.* Check that $\sss$ and $\widetilde{\sss}$ are charts:

- $\sss$ is smooth.
- $U$ is open in $\R^2$.
- Moreover
$$
\sss (U) = \sphere^2 \smallsetminus \{ (x,0,z) \in \R^3 \divider x \leq 0  \} \,.
$$
This is clearly an open set in $\sphere^2$. 
- The spherical coordinates on the sphere are invertible. Therefore $\sss$ is invertible, with continuous inverse. 
- Thus, $\sss$ is a homeomorphism from $U$ into $\sss(U)$.
- This shows $\sss$ is a chart of $\sphere^2$.
- Since $\widetilde{\sss}$ is obtained from $\sss$ by composing two rotations, we conclude that also $\widetilde{\sss}$ is a chart.

Show that $\sss$ is a regular chart:
\begin{align*}
\sss_{\theta} & = (-\sin(\theta) \cos(\fi), \cos(\theta) \cos(\fi), 0 ) \\
 \sss_{\fi} & = ( - \cos(\theta) \sin(\fi), -\sin(\theta) \sin(\fi), \cos(\fi) )  \,.
\end{align*} 
Since $(\theta,\fi)\in U$, we have $\fi \in ( -\pi/2, \pi/2 )$. Therefore, the last component of $\sss_\fi$ is non-zero, i.e.,
$$
\cos(\fi) \neq 0  \,, \quad \forall \, \fi \in \left( -\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}  \right) \,.
$$
Since the last component of $\sss_\theta$ is $0$, we conclude that $\sss_\theta$ and $\sss_{\fi}$ are linearly independent for all $(\theta,\fi) \in U$. Therefore $\sss$ is regular. Alternatively, we could have computed:
$$
\sss_{\theta} \times \sss_{\fi} = 
( \cos(\theta) \cos^2(\fi), \sin(\theta) \cos^2(\fi), \cos(\fi)\sin(\fi) ) \,,
$$
from which
$$
\norm{ \sss_{\theta} \times \sss_{\fi} } = |\cos (\fi)| \, .
$$
Since $(\theta,\fi)\in U$, we have $\fi \in ( -\pi/2, \pi/2 )$, and so
$$
\norm{ \sss_{\theta} \times \sss_{\fi} } = \cos (\fi)  \neq 0 \,.
$$
Thus $\sss_{\theta}$ and $\sss_{\fi}$ are linearly independent, and $\sss$ is regular. 

Since $\widetilde{\sss}$ is obtained from $\sss$ by applying two rotations, it follows that $\widetilde{\sss}$ is regular. Therefore 
$$
\mathcal{A} = \{ \sss, \widetilde{\sss}\}
$$ 
is a regular atlas for $\sphere^2$.

In alternative, the sphere can be parametrized in Cartesian coordinates.




::: Example
### Unit sphere in Cartesian coordinates {#example-sphere-cartesian}

Consider the unit sphere in $\R^3$
$$
\sphere^2 := \left\{  (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1  \right\} \,.
$$
Define the collection of charts
$$
\mathcal{A} = \{ \sss_i \}_{i=1}^6 \,,
$$
where $\sss_i$ is defined as follows: Let 
$$
U:= \{ (u,v) \in \R^2 \colon u^2 + v^2 < 1  \}
$$
be the unit open ball in $\R^2$, and define $\sss_i \colon U \to \R^3$ by
\begin{align*}
\sss_1 (u,v) & = \left(u,v,\sqrt{1-u^2-v^2}  \right) \\
\sss_2 (u,v) & = \left(u,v,-\sqrt{1-u^2-v^2}  \right) \\
\sss_3 (u,v) & = \left(u,\sqrt{1-u^2-v^2},v  \right) \\
\sss_4 (u,v) & = \left(u, -\sqrt{1-u^2-v^2}, v  \right) \\
\sss_5 (u,v) & = \left(\sqrt{1-u^2-v^2} , u ,v \right) \\
\sss_6 (u,v) & = \left(-\sqrt{1-u^2-v^2}, u,v,  \right) \\
\end{align*}
We have that $\mathcal{A}$ is a regular atlas, showing that $\sphere^2$ is a regular surface. 

> Let us check that $\sphere^2$ is a surface:
>
- $\sss_1$ is smooth, since in $U$ we have $u^2+v^2<1$.
- $U$ is open, being the open ball of radius $1$ in $\R^2$.
- $\sss_1(U)$ is clearly open in $\sphere^2$: This is because $\sss_1(U)$ coincides with the Northern Hemisphere, with the Equator Line removed.
- The inverse of $\sss_1$ is given by $\sss^{-1} \colon \sss_1(U) \to U$ defined by
$$
\sss^{-1}(u,v,\sqrt{1-u^2-v^2}) := (u,v) \,.
$$
- $\sss^{-1}$ is continuous, and thus $\sss_1$ is a homeomorphism of $U$ with $\sss_1(U)$.
- With similar arguments, we can see that all the maps $\sss_i$ are charts.
- Note that $\sss_1$ charts the Northern Hemisphere (excluding the Equator), while $\sss_2$ charts the Southern Hemisphere (excluding the Equator). Thus,
$$
\sss_1(U) \cup \sss_2(U) = \sphere^2 \smallsetminus \{z = 0 \} \,.
$$
By including the other 4 charts $\sss_3,\sss_4,\sss_5,\sss_6$, we can cover the whole sphere, that is,
$$
\sphere^2 = \bigcup_{i=1}^6 \sss_i(U) \,.
$$
This shows that $\mathcal{A} = \{ \sss_i\}_{i=1}^6$ is an atlas for $\sphere^2$.
>
> Let us now check that $\sphere^2$ is a regular surface:
>
- The first chart $\sss_1$ has derivatives
$$
(\sss_1)_u = (1,0,f_u) \,, \quad 
(\sss_1)_v = (0,1,f_v) \,,
$$
where $f_u,f_v$ are the partial derivatives of 
$$
f(u,v):=\sqrt{1-u^2-v^2} \,.
$$
Therefore, the Jacobian matrix of $\sss_1$ is
$$
J\sss_1 (u,v) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
1  &  0 \\
0  &  1 \\
f_u  & f_v \\
\end{array} 
\right) \,.
$$
The first minor of $J\sss_1$ is the identity matrix, and therefore $J\sss$ has rank 2, showing that $(\sss_1)_u$ and $(\sss_2)_v$ are linearly independent. Hence $\sss_1$ is regular.
- Clearly, $J\sss_i$ has rank 2 for each of the charts $\sss_i$. Therefore $\sss_i$ is regular.
- We conclude that $\mathcal{A}$ is a regular atlas, making $\sphere^2$ a regular surface.



:::



Let us conclude the section with the example of a non-regular surface.


::: Example

The surface parametrized by 
$$
\sss(u,v) = (u,v^2,v^3) \,, \quad \forall (u,v) \in \R^2
$$
is not regular. This is because
$$
\sss_u = (1,0,0) \,, \quad
\sss_v = (0,2v,3v^2)
$$
and therefore 
$$
\sss_v(u,0) = (0,0,0) \,, 
$$
showing that $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ are linearly dependent along the line
$$
L = \{ (u,0) \divider u \in \R \} \,.
$$
Hence $\sss$ is not a regular chart.

Looking at Figure @fig-plot-cusp, it is clear that $\SSS$ is not regular, since $\SSS$ has a cusp along the line $\sss(L)$.

## Reparametrizations


We have already considered reparametrizations when we studied curves. In a similar way, one can reparametrize surface charts.


::: Definition

Suppose that $U, \widetilde{U} \subseteq \R^2$ are open sets and 
$$
\sss \colon U \to \R^3 \,, \quad 
\widetilde{\sss} \colon \widetilde{U} \to \R^3 \,,
$$ 
are surface charts. We say that $\widetilde{\sss}$ is a **reparametrization** of $\sss$ if there exists a diffeomorphism
$$
\Phi \colon \widetilde{U} \to U \,,
$$
such that 
$$
\widetilde{\sss} = \sss \circ \Phi \,,
$$
that is,
$$
\widetilde{\sss}( \tilde{u},\tilde{v} ) = \sss (  \Phi ( \tilde{u},\tilde{v}) ) \,, \quad \forall \,\, (\tilde{u},\tilde{v} ) \in 
\widetilde{U} \,.
$$
We call $\Phi$ a **reparametrization map**.
:::



![Schematic illustration of surface chart $\sss$ and reparametrization $\widetilde{\sss}$.](/images/surface_reparametrization.png){width=80%}


We will show that reparametrizations of regular charts are regular. To prove this, first we need to recall the chain rule for vector valued functions of several variables.

::: Remark
### Chain rule

Suppose that $U, \widetilde{U} \subseteq \R^2$ are open sets, 
$$
f \colon U \to \R^3 
$$
is smooth, and 
$$
\Phi \colon \widetilde{U} \to U
$$
is a diffeomorphism. Define $\tilde{f} \colon \widetilde{U} \to \R^3$ by composition:
$$
\tilde{f} := f \circ \Phi \,.
$$
Explicitly, the above means
$$
\tilde{f}( \tilde{u},\tilde{v} ) = f (  \Phi ( \tilde{u},\tilde{v}) ) \,, \quad \forall \,\, (\tilde{u},\tilde{v} ) \in 
\widetilde{U} \,.
$$
We denote the components of $f, \tilde{f}$ and $\Phi$ by
$$
\tilde{f} = (\tilde{f}^1, \tilde{f}^2, \tilde{f}^3) \,, \quad 
f = (f^1,f^2,f^3) \,, \quad 
\Phi = (\Phi^1, \Phi^2) \,. 
$$
The Jacobians are
$$
J \tilde{f} = \left(   
\begin{array}{cc}
 \tilde{f}^1_{\tilde u}  & \tilde{f}^1_{\tilde v}  \\
 \tilde{f}^2_{\tilde u}  & \tilde{f}^2_{\tilde v}  \\
 \tilde{f}^3_{\tilde u}  & \tilde{f}^3_{\tilde v}
\end{array}
\right) \,, \quad
J f = \left(   
\begin{array}{cc}
 {f}^1_{u}  &  {f}^1_{v}  \\
 {f}^2_{u}  &  {f}^2_{v}  \\
 {f}^3_{u}  &  {f}^3_{v}
\end{array}
\right) \,, \quad 
J \Phi = \left(   
\begin{array}{cc}
 {\Phi}^1_{\tilde u}  &  {\Phi}^1_{\tilde v}  \\
 {\Phi}^2_{\tilde u}  &  {\Phi}^2_{\tilde v}  
\end{array}
\right) \,.
$$

The chain rule states that
$$
J \tilde{f} (\tilde u, \tilde v) = Jf ( \Phi (\tilde u, \tilde v) ) \,
J\Phi (\tilde u, \tilde v) \,.
$$
By carrying out the matrix multiplication on the right hand sinde of the above identity, we obtain the chain rule in vectorial form:
\begin{align*}
\tilde{f}_{\tilde{u}} (\tilde{u}, \tilde{v}) & = 
f_u ( \Phi(\tilde{u}, \tilde{v}) ) \Phi_{\tilde{u}}^1 (\tilde{u}, \tilde{v}) + f_v ( \Phi(\tilde{u}, \tilde{v}) ) \Phi_{\tilde{u}}^2 (\tilde{u}, \tilde{v}) \\ 
\tilde{f}_{\tilde{v}} (\tilde{u}, \tilde{v}) & = 
f_u ( \Phi(\tilde{u}, \tilde{v}) ) \Phi_{\tilde{v}}^1 (\tilde{u}, \tilde{v}) + f_v ( \Phi(\tilde{u}, \tilde{v}) ) \Phi_{\tilde{v}}^2 (\tilde{u}, \tilde{v}) 
\end{align*}
The above expressions are quite cumbersome. This motivates the introduction of more compact notations for reparametrizations and chain rule. Specifically, we denote the components of the diffeomorphism $\Phi$ by
\begin{align*}
\Phi^1 \quad & \leadsto \quad (\tilde u, \tilde v) \mapsto u (\tilde u, \tilde v)  \\
\Phi^2 \quad & \leadsto \quad (\tilde u, \tilde v) \mapsto v (\tilde u, \tilde v) 
\end{align*}
Accordingly, the Jacobian of $\Phi$ is denoted by:
$$
J \Phi = \left(   
\begin{array}{cc}
 {\Phi}^1_{\tilde u}  &  {\Phi}^1_{\tilde v}  \\
 {\Phi}^2_{\tilde u}  &  {\Phi}^2_{\tilde v}  
\end{array}
\right)   \quad \leadsto \quad 
\left(   
\begin{array}{cc}
 \dfrac{\partial u}{\partial \tilde u}  &  \dfrac{\partial u}{\partial \tilde v}  \\
 \dfrac{\partial v}{\partial \tilde u}  &  \dfrac{\partial v}{\partial \tilde v}
\end{array}
\right)  \,.
$$
Hence, the chain rule in vectorial form reads
\begin{align*}
\tilde{f}_{\tilde{u}}  & = 
f_u  \frac{\partial u}{\partial \tilde{u}} + f_v  \frac{\partial v}{\partial \tilde{u}} \\ 
\tilde{f}_{\tilde{v}}  & = 
f_u  \, \frac{\partial u}{\partial \tilde{v}}  + f_v  \frac{\partial v}{\partial \tilde{v}} 
\end{align*}

We will now prove that the reparametrization of a regular chart is regular.



::: {.Proposition  #proposition-transition-maps}

Suppose that $U, \widetilde{U} \subseteq \R^2$ are open sets and 
$$
\sss \colon U \to \R^3 
$$ 
is a regular chart. Assume given a diffeomorphism
$$
\Phi \colon \widetilde{U} \to U \,.
$$
The reparametrization $\widetilde{\sss} \colon \widetilde{U} \to \R^3$ defined by 
$$
\widetilde{\sss} = \sss \circ \Phi
$$
is a regular chart, and it holds
$$
 \widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde u} \times \widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde v} =\det  J \Phi \,  \left( \sssu \times \sssv  \right)

:::


::: Proof

Since $\sss$ is a regular chart we have that $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ are linearly independent. Hence
$$
\sss_u \times \sss_v \neq 0 \,.
$$
To see that $\widetilde{\sss}$ is regular it is sufficient to prove that
$$
\widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde u} \times \widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde v} \neq 0 \,.

## Transition maps

Suppose that a surface $\SSS$ has atlas given by $\mathcal{A} = \{ \sss_i \}_{i \in I}$. By definition of atlas, it holds that
$$
\SSS = \bigcup_{i \in I} \sss_i (U_i) \,.
$$
As the images $\sss_i (U_i)$ are open in $\SSS$, and cover the whole surface, in general it will happen that two (or more) images will overlap, i.e.,
$$
I := \sss_i(U_i) \cap \sss_j(U_j) \neq \emptyset \,,
$$
for some $i \neq j$.
It is natural to ask whether the charts $\sss_i$ and $\sss_j$ are reparametrizations of each other on the overlapping region $I$, see @fig-transition-maps. This is indeed the case, see Proposition \ref{proposition-transition-map} below. Such reparametrization is called a *transition map*.


![If the two regular charts $\sss$ and $\widetilde{\sss}$ have overlapping image, then they are reparametrization of each other, through a transition map $\Phi =  {\sss}^{-1} \circ \wsss$.](/images/surfaces_transition_map.png){#fig-transition-maps width=80%}



::: Definition
### Transition map

Let $\SSS$ be a regular surface and 
$$
\sss \colon U \to  \SSS \,, \quad
\widetilde{\sss} \colon \widetilde{U} \to  \SSS
$$
be regular charts. Suppose the images of $\sss$ and $\widetilde{\sss}$ overlap, that is,
$$
I := \sss (U) \cap \widetilde{\sss} (\widetilde{U}) \neq \emptyset \,.
$$
The set $I$ is open in $\SSS$, being intersection of open sets. Define the sets
$$
V := \sss^{-1}(I) \subseteq U \,, \quad  \widetilde{V} := \widetilde{\sss}^{-1} (I) \subseteq \widetilde{U} \,.
$$
Note that $V$ and $\widetilde{V}$ are open, by continuity of $\sss$ and $\widetilde{\sss}$. Since $\sss$ and $\widetilde{\sss}$ are homeomorphisms, by construction
$$
\sss(V) = \widetilde{\sss} (\widetilde{V} ) = I \,.
$$
Therefore, they are well defined the restrictions
$$
\sss |_{V} \colon V \to I \,, \quad 
\widetilde{\sss} |_{\widetilde{V}} \colon \widetilde{V} \to I \,.
$$
The maps $\sss |_{V}$ and $\widetilde{\sss} |_{\widetilde{V}}$ are homeomorphisms, being restrictions of homeomorphisms. The composition homeomorphism
$$
\Phi \colon \widetilde{V} \to V \,, \quad \Phi := \sss^{-1} \circ \widetilde{\sss}
$$
is called a **transition map** from $\sss$ to $\widetilde{\sss}$.

The following theorem states that the transition maps between regular charts are diffeomorphisms. The proof is somewhat technical and relies on the Implicit Function Theorem. A similar argument will be used for Lemma \ref{lemma-curve-S} in @sec-tangent-space. We have chosen to omit the proof here, but interested readers can refer to page 117 of [@pressley] for details.


::: {.Theorem #theorem-transition-map}

Let $\SSS$ be a regular surface. The transition maps between regular charts are diffeomorphisms. 

:::

The immediate consequence of Theorem \ref{theorem-transition-map} is that transition maps are reparametrizations. 
To fix notations, let us state this fact precisely.


::: {.Proposition #proposition-transition-map}

Let $\SSS$ be a regular surface and 
$$
\sss \colon U \to \SSS \,, \quad
\widetilde{\sss} \colon \widetilde{U} \to  \SSS
$$
be regular charts. Suppose the images of $\sss$ and $\widetilde{\sss}$ overlap, that is,
$$
I := \sss (U) \cap \widetilde{\sss} (\widetilde{U}) \neq \emptyset \,.
$$
Define the open sets
$$
V := \sss^{-1}(I) \subseteq U \,, \quad  \widetilde{V} := \wsss^{-1}(I) \subseteq \widetilde{U} \,,
$$
and the transition map
$$
\Phi \colon \widetilde{V} \to V \,, \quad \Phi := \sss^{-1}\circ \wsss \,.
$$
Then $\sss$ and $\wsss$ are reparametrization of each other, with reparametrization map given by $\Phi$, that is,
$$
\wsss = \sss \circ \Phi \,, \qquad \sss = \wsss \circ \Phi^{-1} \,.
$$

::: Example
### Reparametrization of $\sphere^2$ {#example-sphere-reparametrization}


In Example \ref{example-sphere-spherical} and Example \ref{example-sphere-cartesian} we gave two different regular parametrizations of the sphere $\sphere^2$:


1. Spherical coordinates: The sphere, excluding the Date Line and the Poles, is charted by
$$
\sss(\theta,\fi) = 
( \cos(\theta) \cos(\fi), \sin(\theta) \cos(\fi), \sin(\fi) ) \,, 
$$
defined over the set
$$
U = \left\{ (\theta,\fi) \in \R^2 \, \colon \,    
 \theta \in (-\pi,\pi) \,, \,\, \fi \in \left( -\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}  \right) \right\} \,.
$$

2. Cartesian coordinates: The Northen Hemisphere is charted by
$$
\widetilde{\sss}(u,v) = (u,v, \sqrt{1 - u^2 - v^2 }) \,,
$$
defined over the set
$$
\widetilde{U} = \{ (u,v) \in \R^2 \, \colon \,  u^2 + v^2 < 1 \} \,.
$$

The intersection of the images
$$
I = \sss(U) \cap \widetilde{\sss} (\widetilde{U})
$$
is non-empty. Indeed, the two charts overlap across the Northern Hemisphere, excluding the Date Line and North Pole. Define the open sets
$$
V := \sss^{-1} (I) \,, \quad \widetilde{V} := \widetilde{\sss}^{-1} (I) \,,
$$
and the transition map 
$$
\Phi \colon \widetilde{V} \to V \,, \quad 
\Phi:= \sss^{-1} \circ \widetilde{\sss} \,. 
$$
Since $\sss$ and $\widetilde{\sss}$ are regular, 
Proposition \ref{proposition-transition-map} guarantees that $\Phi$ is a reparametrization map. Therefore $\sss$ and $\widetilde{\sss}$ are reparametrization of each other, with 
$$
\widetilde{\sss} = \sss \circ \Phi \,.
$$
Conclusion: the two parametrizations $\sss$ and $\widetilde{\sss}$ of $\sphere^2$ are interchangeable!

:::


::: Important

Proposition \ref{proposition-transition-map} demonstrates that there is no single preferred way to parametrize a surface: When two regular charts overlap, they are reparametrizations of each other in the overlapping region.

This observation has a significant consequence: 

*It allows us to define a property of any regular surface by using charts, as long as we ensure that the definition is independent of reparametrization and, therefore, of the specific chart chosen.*

## Functions between surfaces


We aim to define the concept of a smooth function 
$$
f \colon \SSS_1 \to \SSS_2 \,,
$$
where $\SSS_1$ and $\SSS_2$ are regular surfaces. Up to this point, we only know how to define smooth functions from $\R^n$ to $\R^m$. The idea is to use surface charts to extend this definition of smoothness to functions between surfaces, see @fig-smooth-functions.


::: Definition  
### Smooth functions between surfaces {#definition-smooth-map-surface}

Let $\SSS_1$ and $\SSS_2$ be regular surfaces and let 
$$
f \colon \SSS_1 \to \SSS_2 
$$
be a map. We say that:

1. $f$ is *smooth at $\pp \in \SSS_1$*, if there exist charts $\sss_i \colon U_i \to \SSS_i$ for $i=1,2$ such that
$$
\pp \in \sss_1(U_1)\,, \quad f(\pp) \in \sss_2(U_2) 
$$
and 
$$
(\sss_2^{-1} \circ f \circ \sss_1 )  \colon U_1 \to U_2
$$
is smooth.

2. $f$ is *smooth*, if it is smooth for each $\pp \in \SSS_1$.

:::

::: Remark

1. Definition \ref{definition-smooth-map-surface} makes sense because $\sss_2^{-1}$ exists.

2. The map $\sss_2^{-1} \circ f \circ \sss_1$ is only defined for the points $\xx \in U_1$ such that
$$
f ( \sss_1 (\xx) ) \in \sss_2 (U_2) \,.
$$

3. The function $\sss_2^{-1} \circ f \circ \sss_1$ maps from $\R^2$ into $\R^2$, therefore smoothness is intended in the classical sense.

4. Definition \ref{definition-smooth-map-surface} is well-posed: Smoothness of $f$ does not depend on the specific choice of charts $\sss_1$ and $\sss_2$.  

    > Indeed, suppose that $\widetilde{\sss}_{i} \colon \widetilde{U}_i \to {\SSS}_i$ are charts such that 
    $$
    \pp \in \widetilde{\sss}_1( \widetilde{U}_1) \,, \quad  f(\pp) \in \widetilde{\sss}_2(\widetilde{U}_2) \,.
    $$
    In particular we have
    $$
    \sss_i(U_i) \cap \widetilde{\sss}_i (\widetilde{U}_i) \neq \emptyset \,.
    $$
    As $\SSS_1$ and $\SSS_2$ are regular surfaces, by Theorem \ref{theorem-transition-map} there exist open sets
    $$
    V_i \subseteq U_i \,, \qquad \widetilde{V}_i \subseteq \widetilde{U}_i \,,
    $$
    and reparametrization maps 
    $$
    \Phi_i \colon \widetilde{V}_i \to V_i \,, \qquad 
    \widetilde{\sss}_i = \sss_i \circ \Phi_i \,.
    $$
    Hence
    \begin{align*}
    \widetilde{\sss}_2^{-1} \circ f \circ \widetilde{\sss}_1 & =
    \widetilde{\sss}_2^{-1} \circ ( \sss_2 \circ \sss_2^{-1} ) \circ f \circ  ( \sss_1 \circ \sss_1^{-1} ) \circ \widetilde{\sss}_1  \\
    & = ( \widetilde{\sss}_2^{-1} \circ  \sss_2 ) \circ ( \sss_2^{-1}  \circ f \circ   \sss_1 ) \circ (\sss_1^{-1}  \circ \widetilde{\sss}_1 )  \\
    & = \Phi_2^{-1} \circ ( \sss_2^{-1}  \circ f \circ   \sss_1 )  \circ \Phi_1 \,.
    \end{align*}
    Since $\Phi_1$, $\Phi_2^{-1}$ and $\sss_2^{-1}  \circ f \circ   \sss_1$ are smooth, we conclude that
    $$
    \widetilde{\sss}_2^{-1} \circ f \circ \widetilde{\sss}_1
    $$
    is smooth. Hence Definition \ref{definition-smooth-map-surface} does not depend on the choice of charts.
:::




::: Proposition

If $f \colon \SSS_1 \to \SSS_2$ and $g \colon \SSS_2 \to \SSS_3$ are smooth maps between surfaces, then the composition 
$$
(g \circ f) \colon \SSS_1 \to \SSS_3
$$
is smooth.


:::


::: Proof

Fix $\pp \in \SSS_1$ and choose charts
$$
\sss_i \colon U_i \to \SSS_i 
$$
such that 
$$
\pp \in \sss_1 (U_1) \,, \quad
f(\pp) \in \sss_2 (U_2) \,, \quad
g(f(\pp)) \in \sss_3 (U_3) \,.
$$
Since $f$ and $g$ are smooth, by definition the maps
$$
\sss_2^{-1} \circ f  \circ \sss_1 \,, \qquad \sss_3^{-1} \circ  g \circ \sss_2  \,,
$$
are smooth. Hence
$$
\sss_3^{-1} \circ ( g \circ f ) \circ \sss_1 = ( \sss_3^{-1} \circ  g \circ \sss_2 ) \circ (\sss_2^{-1} \circ f  \circ \sss_1)  
$$
is smooth, ending the proof.

The inverse function of a chart is a differentiable.

:::{.Proposition  #proposition-inverse-diff}

Let $\SSS$ be a regular surface, and $\sss \colon U \to \SSS$ a regular chart. The inverse
$$
\sss^{-1} \colon \sss(U) \to U \subseteq \R^2 \,,
$$
is a differentiable function.

:::

::: Proof

First of all, note that: 

- $\sss^{-1}$ exists, as $\sss$ is required to be a homeomorphism;

- $\sss(U)$ can be regarded as a surface, being an open subset of the surface $\SSS$.

Let $\pp \in \sss(U)$ and $\wsss \colon \wU \to \SSS$ be a regular chart at $\pp$, that is,
$$
p \in \wsss(\wU) \,.
$$
In order to prove that $\sss^{-1} \colon \sss(U) \to \R^2$ is a differentiable map, we need to check that the map
$$
\sss^{-1} \circ \wsss
$$
is differentiable (where it is defined). To this end, define the intersection
$$
I :=  \sss(U) \cap \wsss(\wU)\,.
$$
Clearly $I \neq \emptyset$, since $\pp \in I$. We can then define the open sets
$$
V = \sss^{-1}(I)\,, \quad \widetilde{V} = \wsss^{-1}(I) \,,
$$
and the transition map 
$$
\Phi \colon \widetilde{V} \to V \,, \quad \Phi := \sss^{-1} \circ \wsss \,.
$$
By Theorem \ref{theorem-transition-map}, the map $\Phi$ is differentiable. As $\Phi = \sss^{-1} \circ \wsss$, the proof is concluded.

:::


The following Proposition gives a very useful sufficient condition to check differentiability.


:::{.Proposition  #proposition-diff-check}

Let $\SSS_1$ and $\SSS_2$ be regular surfaces. Make the following assumptions:

1. $V \subseteq \R^3$ is an open set such that 
$$
\SSS_1 \subseteq V \,,
$$
2. $f \colon V \to \R^3$ is a differentiable function such that  
$$
f(\SSS_1) \subseteq \SSS_2 \,.
$$

Then the restriction 
$$
f |_{\SSS_1} \colon \SSS_1 \to \SSS_2 
$$
is a differentiable map between surfaces.

:::


::: Proof

Let $\pp \in \SSS_1$ and charts $\sss_1: U_1 \to \SSS_1$, $\sss_2: U_2 \to \SSS_2$, with 
$$
p \in \sss_1(U_1) \,, \qquad f(\pp) \in \sss_2(U_2) \,.
$$
The map
$$
\sss_2^{-1} \circ f \circ \sss_1: U_1 \to U_2 
$$
is differentiable because composition of differentiable functions: $\sss_2^{-1}$ is differentiable by Proposition \ref{proposition-inverse-diff}; $f$ is differentiable by assumption; $\sss_1$ is differentiable by definition of chart. 

:::


::: Example

Let $\SSS$ be a regular surface.

1. Assume $\SSS$ is symmetric relative to the $\{z=0\}$ plane, that is, 
$$
(x, y, z) \in \SSS \quad \iff \quad (x, y,-z) \in \SSS \,.
$$
Then the map $f \colon  \SSS \to \SSS$, which takes $p \in S$ into its symmetrical point, is differentiable. This is because $f$ is the restriction to $\SSS$ of the map 
$$
f\colon \R^3 \to \R^3, \qquad  f(x, y, z)=(x, y,-z) \,,
$$
which is clearly differentiable.

2. Let $\pi \colon \SSS \to \R^2$ be the map which takes each $\pp \in \SSS$ into its orthogonal projection over
$$
\R^2 = \{ (x,y,0)  \,\colon  \, x,y \in \R  \} \,.
$$
$\pi$ is differentiable because restriction of the differentiable map
$$
\pi \colon \R^3 \to \R^3 \,, \quad \pi (x,y,z) = (x,y,0) \,.
$$


3. Let $f \colon \R^3 \to \R^3$ be given by 
$$
f(x, y, z)=(x a, y b, z c) \,,
$$
where $a, b$, and $c$ are non-zero real numbers. Clearly, $f$ is differentiable. Therefore, the restriction $f|_{\sphere^2}$ is a differentiable map from the Sphere
$$
\sphere^2 = \left\{(x, y, z) \in \R^3 \, \colon \, x^2+y^2+z^2=1\right\}
$$
into the Ellipsoid
$$
\mathbb{E} = \left\{(x, y, z) \in \R^3 \, \colon \, \frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}+\frac{z^2}{c^2}=1\right\} \,,
$$
because $f(\sphere^2) \subseteq \mathbb{E}$.

### Diffeomorphism of surfaces

Let $\SSS_1$ and $\SSS_2$ be regular surfaces. 

1. A map $f \colon \SSS_1 \to \SSS_2$ is a **diffeomorphism**, if $f$ is smooth and admits smooth inverse.

2. We say that $\SSS_1$ and $\SSS_2$ are **diffeomorphic**, if there exists $f \colon \SSS_1 \to \SSS_2$ diffeomorphism.

:::



The key ideas around diffeomorphisms are:

1. Two diffeomorphic surfaces are essentially the same.  

    >It is easy to check that being diffeomorphic is an equivalence relation on the set of regular surfaces. Therefore, two diffeomorphic surfaces can be identified.

2. Two diffeomorphic surfaces have essentially the same charts, as shown in the next Proposition.


::: {.Proposition  #proposition-f-chart}

Let $\SSS$ and $\widetilde{\SSS}$ be regular surfaces and $f \colon \SSS \to \widetilde{\SSS}$ be a diffeomorphism. If 
$\sss \colon U \to \SSS$ is a regular chart for $\SSS$ at $\pp$, then
$$
\widetilde{\sss}   \colon U \to \widetilde{\SSS} \,, \qquad \widetilde{\sss} := f \circ \sss \,,
$$
is a regular chart for $\widetilde{\SSS}$ at $f(\pp)$.

:::


::: Proof

Let $\sss_2 \colon U_2 \to \widetilde{\SSS}$ be a regular chart for $\widetilde{\SSS}$ at $f(\pp)$. By definition of diffeomorphism between surfaces, the map
$$
\Phi \colon U \to U_2 \,, \qquad \Phi := \sss_2^{-1} \circ f \circ \sss \,,
$$
is a diffeomorphism. Therfore 
$$
(f \circ \sss) (u,v) = \sss_2  \left( \Phi(u,v) \right)
$$
with $\Phi$ diffeomorphism, meaning that $f \circ \sss$ is a reparametrization of 
$\sss_2$. Since $\sss_2$ is regular, by Proposition \ref{proposition-transition-maps} we deduce
that $f \circ \sss$ is regular.

:::


We conclude with the definition of local diffeomorphism between surfaces.

::: Definition
### Local diffeomorphism

Let $\SSS_1$ and $\SSS_2$ be regular surfaces, and 
$$
f \colon \SSS_1 \to \SSS_2 \,,
$$
be a differentiable map.

1. $f$ is a **local diffeomorphism** at $\pp \in \SSS_1$ if:
    * There exists An open set $V \subseteq \SSS_1$ with $\pp \in V$; 
    * $f(V) \subseteq \SSS_2$ is open;
    * $f \colon V \to f(V)$ is a diffeomorphism between surfaces.

2. $f$ is a **local diffeomorphism** in $\SSS_1$, if it is a local diffeomorphism at each $\pp \in \SSS_1$.

3. $\SSS_1$ is **locally diffeomorphic** to $\SSS_2$, if for each $\pp \in \SSS_1$ there exists $f$ local diffeomorphism at $\pp$.

:::

Two remarks:

1. The above definition is well-posed, since open subsets of surfaces are themselves surfaces.
2. Being locally diffeomorphic is **not** an equivalence relation: $\SSS_1$ **locally diffeomorphic** to $\SSS_2$ does not imply that $\SSS_2$ is **locally diffeomorphic** to $\SSS_1$.




## Tangent space {#sec-tangent-space}


The tangent vector to a curve $\g \colon \R \to \R^3$ at the point $\g(t)$ is just $\dg(t)$, the derivative of the curve at $t$. Tangent vectors to a surface $\SSS$ can be defined as the tangent vectors of curves $\g \colon \R \to \SSS$ with values in $\SSS$, see @fig-tangent-plane.


To simplify statements, we make the following assumption.


::: Assumption

From now on, all the surfaces will be regular and all the charts will be regular.

::: Definition
### Tangent vectors and tangent space

Let $\SSS$ be a surface and $\pp \in \SSS$. 

1. We say that $\vv \in \R^3$ is 
a **tangent vector** to $\SSS$ at $\pp$, if there exists a smooth curve
$$
\g \colon (-\e,\e) \to \R^3 \,, 
$$
such that
$$
\g (-\e , \e) \subseteq \SSS \,, \quad \g(0) = \pp \,, \quad \vv = \dg(0) \,,
$$
where $\e>0$. 

2. The **tangent space** of $\SSS$ at $\pp$ is the set
$$
T_{\pp} \SSS := \{ \vv \in \R^3 \divider \vv \, \mbox{ tangent vector of } \, \SSS \, \mbox{ at } \, \pp \} \,.
$$


:::



![Tangent space $T_{\pp} \SSS$ of surface $\SSS$ at the point $\pp$. A tangent vector $\vv$ has to satisfy $\vv = \dg(0)$, for some smooth curve $\g \colon (-\e,\e) \to \SSS$ such that $\g(0)= \pp$.](/images/tangent_space.png){#fig-tangent-plane width=80%}



Let us start with the most basic example: We want to compute the tangent space to an open set in $\R^2$. 


::: {.Example #example-tangent-open-set}

Let $U \subseteq \R^2$ be open and $\pp \in U$. Then 
$$
T_{\pp} U = \R^2 \,.
$$

> Proof. Suppose first that $\vv \in T_{\pp} U$. By definition of tangent vector, there exists a smooth curve
$$
\gamma \colon (-\e,\e) \to U
$$
such that 
$$
\g(0) = \pp \, \qquad \dg(0)=\vv \,.
$$ 
Since $U \subseteq \R^2$, it follows that $\g$ is a plane curve, so that 
$$
\vv = \dg (0) \in \R^2 \,.
$$
Conversely, let $\vv \in \R^2$. Since $\pp \in U$, and $U$ is open, there
exists $\e>0$ such that $B_{\e}(\pp) \subseteq U$. Define the curve
$$
\g \colon (-\e,\e) \to \R^3 \,, \quad \g(t):= \pp + t \vv \,.  
$$
By construction
$$
\g(-\e,\e) \subseteq B_{\e} (\pp) \subseteq U \,, \quad \g(0) = \pp \,, \quad \dg(0)= \vv \,,
$$
showing that $\vv \in T_{\pp} U$.

:::


In the above example, we have seen that 
$$
T_{\pp} U = \R^2
$$
for any open set $U \subseteq \R^2$. In general, if $\SSS$ is a regular surface, then $T_{\pp} \SSS$ is a vector space isomorphic to $\R^2$, in symbols
$$
T_{\pp} \SSS \simeq \R^2 \,.
$$
This means that there exists a map
$$
\Phi \colon T_{\pp} \SSS \to \R^2
$$
which is an isomorphism of vector spaces, i.e., $\Phi$ is invertible and linear:
$$
\Phi(\lambda \vv + \mu \ww) = \lambda \Phi(\lambda) + \mu \Phi( \ww)  \,, 
$$
for all $\vv , \ww \in T_{\pp}\SSS$ and $\lambda, \mu \in \R$.

To prove this result, we need a Lemma concerning curves with values on surfaces: The lemma says that when $\SSS$ is regular, all the smooth curves $\g \colon (-\e,\e) \to \R^3$ with values in $\SSS$, are of the form
$$
\g(t) = \sss(u(t),v(t)) \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (-\e_0,\e_0)
$$
for a pair of smooth functions $u,v \colon (-\e,\e) \to \R$, and a suitable $\e_0 \in (0,\e]$.

Let $\g \colon (-\e,\e) \to \R^3$ be a smooth curve, and consider the statements:

1. The curve $\g$ satisfies $\g(0) = \pp$ and 
$$
\g(t) \in \SSS \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (-\e,\e) \,.

2. There exist $\e_0 \in (0,\e]$ and smooth functions
$$

$$
such that
$$
\g(t) = \sss( u(t), v(t) ) \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (-\e_0,\e_0) \,.
$$

We have that:

- Point 1 implies Point 2.
- Point 2 implies Point 1 when $\e_0 = \e$.

:::


::: Proof

*Part 1.* To visualize the geometric ideas of this part of the proof, see @fig-curves-surface. Let $\pp$ in $\SSS$, and assume given a smooth curve $\g \colon (-\e,\e) \to \R^3$ such that $\g(0) = \pp$ and
$$
\g(t) \in \SSS \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (-\e,\e) \,.
$$
Denote the coordinates of the chart $\sss \colon U \to \SSS$ by
$$
\sss(u,v) = (f(u,v), g(u,v), h(u, v)) \,.
$$
The Jacobian of $\sss$ is
$$
J\sss = 
\left(   
\begin{array}{cc}
f_u & f_v \\
g_u & g_v \\
h_u & h_v \\
\end{array}
\right) \,.
$$
Since $\sss$ is regular, by definition $J\sss$ has rank-2 at $(u_0,v_0)$. This means that at least one of the 3 minors
$$
\left(   
\begin{array}{cc}
f_u & f_v \\
g_u & g_v 
\end{array}
\right) \,, \quad 
\left(

f_u & f_v \\
h_u & h_v \\
\end{array}
\right) \,, \quad 
\left(   
\begin{array}{cc}
g_u & g_v \\
h_u & h_v \\
\end{array}
\right) \,.
$$
is invertible. WLOG, assume the first is invertible (the proof in case the other two are invertible is similar). Define the map  
$$
F \colon U \subseteq \R^2 \to \R^2 \,, \qquad F(u,v) := ( f(u,v), g(u,v) ) \,.
$$
The Jacobian of $F$ is 
$$
JF = 
\left(   
\begin{array}{cc}
f_u & f_v \\
g_u & g_v 
\end{array}
\right) \,,
$$
which is invertible at $(u_0,v_0)$ by assumption. Hence, by the Inverse Function Theorem \ref{theorem-inverse-function}, there exist 

- $U_0 \subseteq U$ open set, with $(u_0,v_0) \in U_0$,
- $V \subseteq \R^2$ open set, with $F(u_0,v_0) \in V$,

such that 
$$
F \colon U_0 \to V 
$$
is a diffeomorphism. In particular, the inverse function
$$
F^{-1} \colon V \to U_0
$$
is smooth. Define the projection map
$$
\pi \colon \R^3 \to \R^2 \,, \quad \pi(x,y,z) = (x,y) \,,
$$
and notice that, by construction,
$$
F = \pi \circ \sss \,.
$$
The composition
$$
\pi \circ \g \colon (\e,\e) \to \R^2
$$
is smooth, and such that
\begin{align*}
(\pi \circ \g) (0) & = \pi (\g(0)) \\
                   & = \pi (\pp) \\
                   & = \pi ( \sss(u_0,v_0) ) \\
                   & = F(u_0,v_0) \,.
\end{align*}
Since $F(u_0,v_0) \in V$, with $V$ open in $\R^2$, and since $\pi \circ \g$ is continuous, there exists $\e_0 \in (0,\e]$ such that
$$
(\pi \circ \g)(t) \in V \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (-\e_0,\e_0) \,.
$$
Since $F^{-1}$ maps $V$ into $U_0$, it is well-defined the composition
$$
\eeta \colon (-\e_0, \e_0) \to U_0 \,, \qquad \eeta := F^{-1} \circ \pi \circ \g \,.
$$
Notice that $\eeta$ is smooth, since $F^{-1}, \pi$ and $\g$ are smooth.
In particular, the componenents of $\eeta$ are two smooth functions
$$
u,v \colon (-\e_0,\e_0) \to \R \,,
$$
such that
$$
(u(t),v(t)) = (F^{-1} \circ \pi \circ \g)(t) \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (-\e_0,\e_0) \,.
$${#eq-lemma-curve-S}
We are now ready to conclude:

- Recalling that $F = \pi \circ \sss$, and that $\sss$ is invertible, we infer that
$$
F = \pi \circ \sss \,\, \implies \,\,
F \circ \sss^{-1}  = \pi  \,\, \implies \,\,
\sss^{-1} = F^{-1} \circ \pi    \,.
$$
Hence, we can substitute $F^{-1} \circ \pi  = \sss^{-1}$ in (@eq-lemma-curve-S), and obtain
$$
(u(t),v(t)) = (F^{-1} \circ \pi \circ \g)(t) = (\sss^{-1} \circ \g)(t) \,.
$$
Applying $\sss$ to both sides gives the desired equation

In particular, substituting $t = 0$ in (@eq-lemma-curve-S) gives,
\begin{align*}
(u(0),v(0)) & = (F^{-1} \circ \pi \circ \g )(0)  \\
            & = F^{-1} ((\pi \circ \g )(0) )  \\
            & = F^{-1}(F(u_0,v_0)) \\

showing that 
$$
u(0) = u_0 \,, \qquad v(0) = v_0 \,.

*Part 2.* This part is trivial: Suppose that there exist smooth functions
$$
u , v \colon (-\e,\e) \to \R \,,\quad u(0)=u_0 \,, \quad v(0) = v_0 \,,
$$
such that
$$
\g(t) = \sss( u(t), v(t) ) \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (-\e,\e) \,.
$$
Since $\sss(U) \subseteq \SSS$, it follows that
$$
\g(t) \in \SSS \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (-\e,\e) \,.
$$
Moreover, using that $u(0)=u_0$ and $v(0) = v_0$, we get
$$
\g(0) = \sss(u(0),v(0)) = \sss(u_0,v_0) = \pp \,.

::: {.Theorem #theorem-tangent-plane}

Let $\SSS$ be a (regular) surface and $\pp \in \SSS$. 
Let $\sss \colon U \to \SSS$ be a chart at $\pp$. Denote
$$
(u_0,v_0) = \sss^{-1}(\pp) \,.
$$
The following hold:

1. The tangent space satisfies
$$
T_{\pp} \SSS = \operatorname{span} \{ \sss_u , \sss_v \} := \{  \lambda \sss_u + \mu \sss_v \divider \lambda,\mu \in \R \} \,,
$$
where $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ are evaluated at $(u_0,v_0)$. 

2. The tangent space is a vector space isomorphic to $\R^2$, that is,
$$
T_{\pp} \SSS \simeq \R^2 \,,
$$
with isomorphism $\Phi \colon T_{\pp} \SSS \to \R^2$ given by
$$
\Phi\left(  \lambda \sss_u + \mu \sss_v   \right) = (\lambda, \mu) \,.
$$

:::

::: Proof

*Part 1.* Let $\sss \colon U \to \SSS$ be a chart at $p$. 

- First, suppose $\vv \in T_{\pp} \SSS$. By definition of tangent space, there exists 
a smooth curve $\g \colon (-\e,\e) \to \SSS$ such that
$$
\g(0) = \pp \,, \quad \dg(0) = \vv \,.
$$
By Lemma \ref{lemma-curve-S}, there exist $\e_0 \in (0,\e]$ and smooth functions
$$
u , v \colon (-\e_0,\e_0) \to \R \,,\quad u(0)=u_0 \,, \quad v(0) = v_0 \,,
$$
such that
$$
\g(t) = \sss( u(t), v(t) ) \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (-\e_0,\e_0) \,.
$$
Therefore, by chain rule,
$$
\dg(t) = \sss_u ( u(t),v(t) ) \, \dot{u}(t) +  
\sss_v ( u(t),v(t) ) \, \dot{v}(t) \,.
$$
Evaluating the above at $t=0$ yields
\begin{align*}
\vv & = \dg(0) \\
    & = \sss_u ( u(0),v(0) ) \, \dot{u}(0) +  \sss_v ( u(0),v(0) ) \, \dot{v}(0) \\
    & = \sss_u ( u_0,v_0 ) \, \dot{u}(0) +  \sss_v ( u_0,v_0 ) \, \dot{v}(0)  \,,
\end{align*}
which shows 
$$
\vv \in \operatorname{span} \{  \sss_u (u_0,v_0), \sss_v(u_0,v_0) \} \,.
$$

- Conversely, suppose that 
$$
\vv \in \operatorname{span} \{  \sss_u (u_0,v_0), \sss_v(u_0,v_0) \} \,.
$$
Then, there exist $\lambda,\mu \in \R$ such that
$$
\vv = \lambda \sss_u (u_0,v_0) + \mu \sss_v (u_0,v_0) \,.
$$
The map $s \colon \R \to \R^2$ defined by
$$
s(t) := (u_0 + \lambda t, v_0 + \mu t) \,.
$$
is continuous, being $s$ is the line through $(u_0,v_0)$ in the direction $(\lambda,\mu)$. Moreover, 
$$
s(0) = (u_0,v_0) \in U \,.
$$
Since $U$ is open in $\R^2$, there exists $R>0$ such that
$$
B_R(s(0)) = B_{R}( (u_0,v_0) )  \subseteq U \,.
$$
In particualar, by continuity of $s$, there exists $\e>0$ such that
$$
|t-0| < \e  \quad \implies \quad |s(t)-s(0)| < R \,,
$$
which implies
$$
s(t) = (u_0 + \lambda t, v_0 + \mu t)  \in U \,,\quad \forall \, t \in (-\e,\e) \,.
$$
Therefore, it is well-defined the curve 
$$
\g \colon (-\e,\e) \to \sss(U) \subseteq \SSS \,, \qquad \g := \sss \circ s \,.
$$
Write down the definition of $\g$ explicitly:
$$
\g (t) = \sss (u_0 + \lambda t, v_0 + \mu t) \,.
$$
By chain rule
$$
\dg (t) = \sss_u (u_0+ \lambda t , v_0+ \mu t ) \lambda + \sss_v (u_0+ \lambda t , v_0+ \mu t ) \mu \,,
$$
and therefore 
$$
\dg(0) = \sss_u (u_0 , v_0 ) \lambda + \sss_v (u_0 ,v_0) \mu = \vv \,.
$$
This proves that $\vv \in T_{\pp} \SSS$, ending the proof of *Part 1*.


*Part 2*. We have shown that
$$
T_{\pp} \SSS = \operatorname{span} \{ \sss_u , \sss_v \}
$$
Since $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ are linearly independent, we conclude that $T_{\pp}\SSS$ is a vector space of dimension 2. Therefore $T_{\pp}\SSS$ is canonically isomorphic to $\R^2$ via the map
$\Phi \colon T_{\pp} \SSS \to \R^2$ given by
$$
\Phi\left(  \lambda \sss_u + \mu \sss_v   \right) = (\lambda, \mu) \,.
$$

:::



Therefore, $T_{\pp} \SSS$ is always two-dimensional. This justifies the following definition.


::: Definition 
### Tangent plane

Let $\SSS$ be a regular surface and $\pp \in \SSS$. The set
$$
T_{\pp} \SSS
$$
is called the **tangent plane** to $\SSS$ at $\pp$.

:::




::: {.Remark  #remark-affine-plane}

By definition, $T_{\pp} \SSS$ is a vector subspace of $\R^3$. 
As such, it holds that 
$$
\zero \in T_{\pp} \SSS \,.
$$

> To see this, take the curve $\g(t) \equiv \pp$. Then $\g(0) = \pp$ and $\dg(0) = \zero$, showing that $\zero \in T_{\pp} \SSS$.

Therefore $T_{\pp} \SSS$ is a plane through the origin, no matter where the point $\pp \in \SSS$ is located. In pictures, such as @fig-tangent-plane, we draw the tangent plane as if it was touching the surfaces at the point $\pp$, and still denote it by $T_{\pp}\SSS$. This is a slight abuse of notation: to be precise, the plane drawn is 
$$
\pp + T_{\pp} \SSS \,,
$$
which is the **affine tangent plane** through $\pp \in \SSS$.

:::


We can easily compute cartesian equations for the tangent plane
$$
T_{\pp} \SSS \,.
$$



::: Proposition
### Equation of tangent plane

Let $\SSS$ be a regular surface and $\pp \in \SSS$. Let $\sss \colon U \to \SSS$ be a regular chart at $\pp$. Set
$$
(u_0,v_0) := \sss^{-1}(\pp) \,, \quad \nn := \sss_u (u_0,v_0) \times \sss_v (u_0,v_0) \,.
$$
They hold:

1. The equation of the tangent plane $T_{\pp} \SSS$ is given by
$$
\xx \cdot \nn = 0 \,, \quad  \forall \, \xx \in \R^3 \,.
$$

2. The equation of the affine tangent plane $\pp + T_{\pp} \SSS$ is given by
$$
(\xx - \pp) \cdot \nn = 0 \,, \quad  \forall \, \xx \in \R^3 \,.
$$

:::


::: Proof

By Theorem \ref{theorem-tangent-plane} we know that
$$
T_{\pp} \SSS = \operatorname{span} \{  \sss_u (u_0,v_0), \sss_v (u_0,v_0) \} \,.
$$
By the properties of cross product, the vector $\nn$ is orthogonal to both
$\sss_u (u_0,v_0)$ and $\sss_v (u_0,v_0)$. Therefore it is orthogonal to
$T_{\pp} \SSS$. The equation for $T_{\pp} \SSS$ is then
$$
\xx \cdot \nn = 0 \,, \quad  \forall \, \xx \in \R^3 \,.
$$
In particular, the equation for the affine tangent plane $\pp + T_{\pp} \SSS$ is
$$
\xx \cdot \nn = k \,, \quad  \forall \, \xx \in \R^3 \,,
$$
for some $k \in \R$. To compute $k$, it is sufficient to evaluate the above equation at any point in $\pp + T_{\pp} \SSS$. Recalling that $\zero \in T_{\pp} \SSS$, we have that $\pp$ belongs to $\pp + T_{\pp} \SSS$. Therefore,
$$
k = \pp \cdot \nn  \,.
$$
Hence the equation for $\pp + T_{\pp} \SSS$ is
$$
( \xx - \pp ) \cdot \nn = 0 \,, \quad  \forall \, \xx \in \R^3 \,,
$$
ending the proof.

:::




::: Example

Consider the surface $\SSS$ defined by the chart
$$
\sss (u,v) := \left(   \sqrt{1-v} \cos(u) , \sqrt{1-v} \sin(u), v  \right) \,,
$$
for $u \in (0,2\pi)$, $v < 1$.

1. Prove that $\sss$ parametrizes a paraboloid, see @fig-paraboloid.
2. Prove that $\sss$ is regular.
3. Compute the vector $\nn = \sssu \times \sssv$
4. Give a basis for $T_{\pp} \SSS$ at the point
$$
\pp = \left( \frac{\sqrt 2}{2}, \frac{\sqrt 2}{2}, 0  \right) \,.
$$
5. Compute the cartesian equations of
$$
T_{\pp} \SSS \quad \text{and} \quad \pp + T_{\pp} \SSS \,.
$$
at the point $\pp$.

*Solution*.

*Point 1.* Denote the coordinates of $\sss$ by
$$
\sss(u,v) = (x,y,z) \,.
$$
We have
\begin{align*}
x^2 + y^2 & = \left( \sqrt{1-v} \cos(u) \right)^2 + \left( \sqrt{1-v} \cos(u) \right)^2 \\
          & = 1 - v  \\
          & = 1 - z \,,
\end{align*}
showing that $\sss$ parametrizes the paraboloid
$$
z = - x^2 - y^2 + 1 \,.
$$

*Point 2.* Proof that $\sss$ is regular:
\begin{align*}
\sss_u & = \left(  - \sqrt{1-v} \sin(u) , \sqrt{1-v} \cos(u), 0        \right) \\
\sss_v & = \left( -   \frac{1}{2} (1-v)^{-1/2}  \cos(u) , -\frac{1}{2} (1-v)^{-1/2}   \sin(u), 1        \right) 
\end{align*}
As the last component of $\sss_u$ is $0$, and the last component of $\sss_v$ is $1$, we conclude that $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ are linearly independent. Thus $\sss$ is regular. 

*Point 3.* We compute:
\begin{align*}
\nn & = \sss_u \times \sss_v \\
    & = 
\left| 
\begin{array}{ccc}
\ii & \jj & \kk \\
-\sqrt{1-v} \sin(u) & \sqrt{1-v} \cos(u) & 0 \\
-\frac{1}{2} (1-v)^{-1/2}  \cos(u) & -\frac{1}{2} (1-v)^{-1/2}   \sin(u) & 1
\end{array}
\right| \\
& = \left(  \sqrt{1-v} \cos(u) , \sqrt{1-v} \sin(u), \frac12        \right) 
\end{align*}

*Point 4.* Define the point 
$$
\pp = \left( \frac{\sqrt 2}{2}, \frac{\sqrt 2}{2}, 0  \right)
$$
and notice that 
$$
\sss \left( \frac{\pi}{4}, 0 \right)  = \pp \,.
$$
By Theorem \ref{theorem-tangent-plane}, we have that a basis for $T_{\pp} \SSS$ is given by the vectors
\begin{align*}
\sss_u  \left( \frac{\pi}{4}, 0 \right) & = \left(  - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} ,  \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} , 0        \right)\,,\\
\sss_v  \left( \frac{\pi}{4}, 0 \right) & = \left( -    \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}  , - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4} , 1        \right) \,.
\end{align*}

*Point 5.* Using the calculation for $\nn$ in Point 3, we find
$$
\nn  \left( \frac{\pi}{4}, 0 \right) 
=  \left(  \frac{\sqrt 2}{2}, \frac{\sqrt 2}{2} , -\frac{1}{2}   \right) \,.
$$
The equation for $T_{\pp} \SSS$ is therefore
$$
\xx \cdot \nn = 0 \,, \quad \forall \, \xx \in \R^3 \,.
$$
The above reads
$$
\frac{\sqrt 2}{2} \, x + \frac{\sqrt 2}{2} \, y - \frac{1}{2} \, z = 0 \,.
$$
The equation for $\pp + T_{\pp} \SSS$ is instead
$$
\frac{\sqrt 2}{2} \, x + \frac{\sqrt 2}{2} \, y - \frac{1}{2} \, z = k \,,
$$
for some $k \in \R$. To compute $k$, note that $\pp \in \pp + T_{\pp} \SSS$, and therefore 
$$
\frac{\sqrt 2}{2} \, \frac{\sqrt 2}{2} + \frac{\sqrt 2}{2} \, \frac{\sqrt 2}{2} = k \quad \implies \quad k = 1 \,.
$$
The equation for $\pp + T_{\pp} \SSS$ is then
$$
\frac{\sqrt 2}{2} \, x + \frac{\sqrt 2}{2} \, y - \frac{1}{2} \, z = 1 \,.
$$

::: Remark
### Tangent space and derivations

The definition of tangent plane depends on the fact that $\SSS$ is contained in $\R^3$. This is a serious drawback in many applications, as the surface $\SSS$ does not necessarily need to be Euclidean. There is a way to get rid of such dependence, and give an *intrinsic* definition of tangent plane, depending only on the point $\pp$ and the surface $\SSS$. 

The basic idea is as follows: If $U \subseteq \R^2$ is open and $\pp \in U$, then $T_{\pp} U = \R^2$. We can associate to any point $\vv \in T_{\pp} U$ a directional derivative acting on smooth functions $f \colon U \to \R$:
$$
\vv = (v_1,v_2) \mapsto \left. \frac{\partial }{\partial v} \right|_p =
v_1 \, \left. \frac{\partial }{\partial x_1} \right|_p +
v_2 \, \left. \frac{\partial }{\partial x_2} \right|_p 
$$
The above directional derivative is called a **derivation**.

The point is that derivations do not need to be defined through vectors, but can be defined as follows: $D$ is a **derivation** if 

- $D \colon C^{\infty}(U) \to \R$ is a linear operator, where $C^{\infty}(U)$ is the set of smooth functions $f \colon U \to \R$,
- $D$ satisfies the Leibnitz rule
$$
D(fg) = f(\pp) D(g) + g(\pp) D(f) \,, \quad \forall \, f,g \in C^{\infty}(U) \,. 
$$

The tangent plane at p can then be defined as
$$
T_{\pp} U = \{ D \, \mbox{ derivation at  } \pp \} \,.
$$
Therefore 
$$
T_{\pp} U \subseteq (C^{\infty}(U))^* \,,
$$ 
the dual space of smooth functions. 

It is possible to do such construction directly on $\SSS$, by introducing the concepts of: 

- **germ** of a function 
- **algebra** of derivations, acting on germs

An in depth discussion can be found in Chapter 3.4 of [@abate-tovena].

## Unit normal and orientability

Let $\SSS$ be a regular surface and $\pp \in \SSS$. The tangent plane $T_{\pp} \SSS$ passes through the origin. Therefore $T_{\pp} \SSS$ is completely determined by giving a unit vector $\NN$ perpendicular to it:
$$
T_{\pp} \SSS = \{ \xx \in \R^3 \divider \xx \cdot \NN = 0 \} \,.
$$
We will also write
$$
\NN \perp T_{\pp} \SSS \,,
$$
to denote that $\NN$ is **perpendicular** to $T_{\pp} \SSS$. Clearly, also $-\NN$ is a unit vector, and
$$
(- \NN) \perp T_{\pp} \SSS \,. 
$$


::: Question 

Which unit normal should we choose between $\NN$ and $-\NN$?

:::

There is no right answer to the above question. One way to proceed is the following.


::: {.Remark   #remark-normal-chart}

Suppose that $\sss \colon U \to \R^3$ is a regular chart for $\SSS$. Let $\pp \in \sss(U)$. Then
$$
T_{\pp} \SSS = \operatorname{span} \{ \sss_u , \sss_v \} \,.
$$
Therefore we can choose the unit normal to $T_{\pp} \SSS$ as 
$$
\NN_{\sss} :=  \frac{ \sss_u \times \sss_v }{ \norm{ \sss_u \times \sss_v } } \,.
$$
Clearly, $\NN_{\sss}$ has unit norm. Moreover 
$$
\NN_{\sss} \cdot \sss_u = 0 \,, \quad \NN_{\sss} \cdot \sss_v = 0
$$
by the properties of cross product. Thus, $\NN_{\sss}$ is perpendicular to $T_{\pp} \SSS$.

There is however an issue: $\NN_{\sss}$ is not independent on the choice of chart $\sss$. Indeed, suppose that $\widetilde{\sss} \colon  \widetilde{U} \to \R^3$ is a reparametrization of $\sss$, that is, 
$$
\widetilde{\sss} = \sss \circ \Phi \,, 
$$
with $\Phi \colon \widetilde{U} \to U$ diffeomorphism. As stated in Proposition \ref{proposition-transition-maps}, we have
$$
\widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde{u}} \times \widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde{v}}
= \det J\Phi \, ( \sss_u \times \sss_v )\,.
$$
Hence
$$
\NN_{\widetilde{\sss}} = \frac{ \widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde{u}} \times \widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde{v}} }{\norm{\widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde{u}} \times \widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde{v}}}} = \frac{\det J\Phi}{|\det J\Phi|} \frac{\sss_u \times \sss_v}{\norm{\sss_u \times \sss_v}} = \pm \NN_{\sss} \,.
$$
Therefore the sign on the right hand side depends on the sign of the Jacobian determinant of the transition map $\Phi$.

:::


The above remark motivates the following definitions.



::: Definition
### Standard unit normal of a chart

Let $\SSS$ be a regular surface and $\sss \colon U \to \R^3$ a regular chart. The **standard unit normal** of $\sss$ is the smooth function
$$
\NN_{\sss} \colon U \to \R^3 \,, \quad \NN_{\sss} := \frac{ \sss_u \times \sss_v }{ \norm{\sss_u \times \sss_v} } \,.

### Charts with same orientation

Let $\SSS$ be a regular surface and $\sss \colon U \to \R^3$,  $\widetilde{\sss} \colon \widetilde{U} \to \R^3$ regular charts such that 
$$
\sss(U) \cap \widetilde{\sss} (\widetilde{U}) \neq \emptyset \,.
$$
Denote by $\Phi$ the transition map between $\widetilde{\sss}$ and $\sss$. We say that: 

1. $\sss$ and $\widetilde{\sss}$ determine the **same orientation** if 
$$
\det J \Phi > 0 \,.
$$

2. $\sss$ and $\widetilde{\sss}$ determine the **opposite orientations** if 
$$
\det J \Phi < 0 \,.
$$

:::



::: Example
### Orientation of the plane

Let $\mathbf{a} , \pp ,\mathbf{q} \in \R^3$, and suppose that $\pp$ and $\mathbf{q}$ are linearly independent.
The plane spanned by $\pp ,\mathbf{q}$ and passing through $\mathbf{a}$ is parametrized by 
$$
\sss (u,v):= \mathbf{a} + \pp u + \mathbf{q} v \,, \quad \forall \, (u,v) \in \R^2 \,.
$$
An alternative parametrization is given by
$$
\widetilde{\sss} (u,v):= \mathbf{a}  + \mathbf{q} u + \pp v  \,, \quad \forall \, (u,v) \in \R^2 \,.
$$
We have
$$
\sss_u = \pp \,, \quad 
\sss_v = \mathbf{q} \,, \quad 
$$
and therefore
$$
\NN_{\sss} = \frac{ \pp \times \mathbf{q}  }{ \norm{ \pp \times \mathbf{q} } } \,.
$$
Similarly, we have
$$
\NN_{\widetilde{\sss}} = \frac{ \mathbf{q} \times \pp   }{ \norm{ \mathbf{q} \times \pp } } =
 \frac{ - \pp \times \mathbf{q}  }{ \norm{ \pp \times \mathbf{q}  } } \,,
$$
showing that
$$
\NN_{\sss} = - \NN_{\widetilde{\sss}} \,.
$$
Hence $\sss$ and $\tilde{\sss}$ determine opposite orientations.

:::





If a surface can be covered by charts with the same orientation, it is called orientable.


::: Definition
### Orientable surface

Let $\SSS$ be a regular surface. Then:

1. Let 
$$
\mathcal{A} = \{ \sss_i \colon U_i \to \SSS\}_{i \in I}
$$ 
be an atlas for $\SSS$. We say that $\mathcal{A}$ is **oriented**, if the following property holds: 
$$
\sss_i (U_i) \cap \sss_j (U_j) \neq \emptyset \quad \implies \quad 
\det J \Phi > 0 \,,
$$
where $\Phi$ is the transition map between $\sss_i$ and $\sss_j$.

2. $\SSS$ is **orientable** if there exists an oriented atlas $\mathcal{A}$.

3. If an oriented atlas $\mathcal{A}$ is assigned, we say that $\SSS$ is **oriented** by $\mathcal{A}$.

:::


::: Warning
### Orientability is a global property

Orientability is a global property: To determine if 
a surface $\SSS$ is orientable, we need to examine the transition maps for the entire atlas 
$\mathcal{A}$. 

:::


::: Example
### MÃ¶bius band

The classical example of non orientable surface is the MÃ¶bius band, see @fig-mobius-ruled. We will discuss this example in more details when we introduce ruled srufaces, see Example \ref{example-mobius}.

:::


::: Example

Let $\sss \colon U \to \R^3$ be a regular chart. Then 
$$
\SSS_{\sss} := \sss(U)
$$ 
is a regular surface with atlas $\mathcal{A}=\{\sss\}$. Therefore $\SSS_{\sss}$ is orientable.

> This is because we have only one chart. Therefore any transition map $\Phi$ will be the identity,
so that $\det J \Phi = 1 > 0$.

:::





::: Remark

Let $\sss$ and $\widetilde{\sss}$ be regular charts with transition map $\Phi$. We have seen in 
Remark \ref{remark-normal-chart} that
$$
\NN_{\widetilde{\sss}} = \frac{ \det J \Phi }{ |\det J \Phi| } \, \NN_{\sss} \,.
$$ 
If $\sss$ and $\widetilde{\sss}$ determine the same orientation, then 
$$
\det J \Phi > 0 \,,
$$
which implies
$$
\NN_{\widetilde{\sss}} =  \NN_{\sss} \,.
$$
Hence, if $\SSS$ is an orientable surface, one can define a unit normal vector at each point of 
$\SSS$, without ambiguity.

2. There exists a unit normal $\NN \colon \SSS \to \R^3$.

:::

The proof follows from the above discussion. For a self-contained proof, we refer the reader to Proposition 4.3.7 in [@abate-tovena].



In view of Propostion \ref{proposition-oriented}, for an oriented surface there is a natural choice of unit normal, 
which we call **standard unit normal** of $\SSS$. 


::: Definition
### Standard unit normal of a surface

Let $\SSS$ be a regular surface oriented by the atlas $\mathcal{A}$. The **standard unit normal**
to $\SSS$ is the map $\NN \colon \SSS \to \R^3$ such that
$$
\NN \circ \sss = \NN_{\sss} \,,
$$
for each chart $\sss \in \mathcal{A}$, where 
$$
\NN_{\sss} \colon U \to \R^3 \,, \quad  \NN_{\sss} = \frac{ \sss_u \times \sss_v }{ \norm{\sss_u \times \sss_v} } \,,
$$
is the standard unit normal of the chart $\sss$.

:::




::: Notation

In the following we will often denote by $\NN$ both the standard unit normal of $\SSS$ and of a chart. 

:::



::: Example

Let $\SSS$ be the surface described by the chart
$$
\sss(u,v) = (e^u, u+v, v ) \,, \quad u,v \in \R \,.
$$
$\SSS$ is regular and orientable, with standard unit normal given by
$$
\NN = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+2 e^{2 u}}} \, \left(1,-e^{u}, e^{u}\right) \,.
$$

*Solution.* Compute the following quantities:
\begin{align*}
\sss_{u} & =\left(e^{u}, 1,0\right) \\
\sss_{v} & =(0,1,1) \\
\sss_{u} \times \sss_{v} & = \left|\begin{array}{ccc}
\ii & \jj & \kk \\
e^{u} & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1
\end{array}\right| \\
& = \left(1,-e^{u}, e^{u}\right)
\end{align*}
Since 
$$
\norm{\sss_u \times \sss_v} =  \sqrt{1+2 e^{2 u}} \geq 1\,,
$$
we see that $\sss_u \times \sss_v \neq \zero$, showing that $\SSS$ is regular. Since the atlas of $\SSS$ is formed by one chart, it follows the $\SSS$ is orientable. The standard unit normal is
$$
\NN  = \frac{ \sss_u \times \sss_v }{ \norm{\sss_u \times \sss_v} }
     = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+2 e^{2 u}}} \, \left(1,-e^{u}, e^{u}\right) \,.
$$

## Differential of smooth functions


Let $f \colon U \to V$ with $U,V \subseteq \R^2$ open. Suppose $f$ is smooth. By definition, the differential of $f$ at $\pp \in U$ is a linear map 
$$
d_{\pp}f \colon \R^2 \to \R^2 
$$
which approximates $f$ locally at $\pp$. 
We have seen in Example \ref{example-tangent-open-set} that
$$
T_{\pp} U = \R^2 \,.
$$
Therefore we can interpret $d_{\pp}f$ as a map between tangent planes:
$$
d_{\pp}f \colon T_{\pp} U \to T_{\pp} U \,.
$$
This reasoning suggests how to define the differential of a smooth map between surfaces: If $f \colon \SSS \to \widetilde{\SSS}$ is smooth, we could define its differential at $\pp \in \SSS$ as a linear map
$$
d_{\pp}f \colon T_{\pp} \SSS \to T_{f(\pp)} \widetilde{\SSS} \,.
$$
How is the above map defined explicitly? To answer this question, we need a Lemma.


::: {.Lemma  #lemma-derivative}

Let $\SSS$ and $\widetilde{\SSS}$ be regular surfaces and $f \colon \SSS \to \widetilde{\SSS}$ a smooth map. Let $\vv \in T_{\pp} \SSS$, and 
$$
\g \colon (-\e,\e) \to \SSS
$$
be a smooth curve such that
$$
\g(0) = \pp \,, \quad \dg(0) = \vv \,.
$$
Define
$$
\tg := f \circ \g \colon (-\e,\e) \to \widetilde{\SSS} \,. 
$$
Then $\tg$ is a smooth curve into $\R^3$ and 
$$
\dtg (0)  \in T_{f(\pp)} \widetilde{\SSS} \,.
$$

:::



::: Proof

Note that 
$$
\tg = i \circ f \circ \g \,, 
$$
with $i \colon \widetilde{\SSS} \to \R^3$ inclusion map. Since $i,f,\g$ are smooth, we conclude that $\tg \colon (-\e,\e) \to \R^3$ is smooth. Moreover 
$$
\tg(0) = f (\g(0)) = f(\pp) \,.
$$
By definition of tangent plane, we conclude that
$$
\dtg (0) \in T_{f(\pp)} \widetilde{\SSS} \,.
$$

:::


Lemma \ref{lemma-derivative} justifies the following definition of differential.


::: Definition
### Differential of smooth function {#definition-differential-f}

Let $\SSS$ and $\widetilde{\SSS}$ be regular surfaces and $f \colon \SSS \to \widetilde{\SSS}$ a smooth map. 
The differential $d_{\pp}f$ of $f$ at $\pp$ is defined as the map
$$
d_{\pp}f \colon T_{\pp} \SSS \to T_{f(\pp)} \widetilde{\SSS} \,,  \quad d_{\pp}f (\vv) := (f \circ \g)'(0) \,,
$$
where $\g \colon (-\e,\e) \to \SSS$ is a smooth curve such that
$$
\g(0) = \pp \,, \qquad  \dg(0) = \vv \,.
$$

:::



We need to show that Definition \ref{definition-differential-f} is well-posed, i.e., that $d_{\pp} f (\vv)$ depends only on $\pp$, $f$, $\vv$: This is because there are infinitely many curves $\g$ such that
$$
\g(0) = \pp \,, \qquad \dg(0) = \vv \,.
$$
Therefore, a priori, $d_{\pp} f (\vv)$ could depend on which curve is chosen. This is however, not the case, as shown in the next Proposition. We will also show that the map $df_{\pp}$ is linear, and compute its matrix. 


::: {.Proposition #proposition-differential-smooth}

Let $\SSS$ and $\widetilde{\SSS}$ be regular surfaces and $f \colon \SSS \to \widetilde{\SSS}$ a smooth map. Denote the differential of $f$ by
$$
d_{\pp}f \colon T_{\pp} \SSS \to T_{f(\pp)} \widetilde{\SSS} \,.
$$
We have:

1. $d_{\pp}f (\vv)$ depends only on $f, \pp,\vv$ (and not on $\g$).

2. $d_{\pp} f$ is linear, that is,
$$
d_{\pp}f (\lambda \vv + \mu \ww) = \lambda d_{\pp}f (\vv) + \mu d_{\pp}f (\ww) \,, 
$$
for all $\vv,\ww \in T_{\pp} \SSS$ and $\lambda,\mu \in \R$.
3. Let 
$$
\sss \colon U \to \SSS \,, \quad \widetilde{\sss} \colon \widetilde{U} \to \widetilde{\SSS} \,,
$$
be regular charts at $\pp$ and $f(\pp)$, respectively. Denote by 
$$
(u,v)  \mapsto ( \alpha(u,v), \beta(u,v) ) 
$$
the components of the smooth map
$$
\Psi := \widetilde{\sss}^{-1} \circ f \circ \sss \colon U \to \widetilde{U} \,.
$$
In particular it holds
$$
\widetilde{\sss} (  \alpha(u,v) , \beta(u,v) ) = f(\sss (u,v)) \,, 
\quad \forall \, (u,v) \in U \,.
$$
The matrix of the linear map $d_{\pp}f$ with respect to the basis 
$$
\{ \sss_u , \sss_v \} \,\, \mbox{ on } \,\, T_{\pp} \SSS \,, \quad
\{ \widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde{u}} , \widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde{v}} \} \,\, \mbox{ on } \,\, T_{f(\pp)} \widetilde{\SSS} \,,
$$
is given by the Jacobian of the map $\Psi$, that is,
$$
d_{\pp} f = J\Psi = \left(
\begin{array}{cc}
\alpha_u & \alpha_v \\
\beta_u & \beta_v \\
\end{array}
\right) \,.
$$


:::


Point 3 in the above Proposition seems complicated, but it is saying something really simple:

1. Let $f \colon \SSS \to \widetilde{\SSS}$ be a smooth function between surfaces. Consider local charts $\sss$ at $\pp$, and $\widetilde{\sss}$ at $f(\pp)$. By definition of smooth map, the real map
$$
\Psi \colon \R^2 \to \R^2 \,, \qquad \Psi := \widetilde{\sss}^{-1} \circ f \circ \sss
$$
is smooth.

2. The matrix of the differential $d_{\pp}f$ with respect to the basis
$$
\{ \sss_u , \sss_v \} \,\, \mbox{ on } \,\, T_{\pp} \SSS \,, \quad
\{ \widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde{u}} , \widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde{v}} \} \,\, \mbox{ on } \,\, T_{f(\pp)} \widetilde{\SSS} \,,
$$
is just the Jacobian of $\Psi$. 



::: Proof

Let $\pp \in \SSS$. In order to prove the thesis, we need compute $d_{\pp} f$. To this end, let $\sss \colon U \to \SSS$ be a chart at $\pp$. Denote
$$
(u_0,v_0) = \sss^{-1}(\pp) \,.
$$
Let $\widetilde{\sss} \colon \widetilde{U} \to \widetilde{\SSS}$ a chart at $f(\pp)$. Since $f$ is smooth, the map
$$
\Psi \colon U \to \widetilde{U} \,, \quad \Psi := \widetilde{\sss}^{-1} \circ f \circ \sss
$$
is smooth. Denote by 
$$
(u,v)  \mapsto ( \alpha(u,v), \beta(u,v) ) 
$$
the smooth components of $\Psi$. By definition of $\Psi$ it holds
$$
\widetilde{\sss} (  \alpha(u,v) , \beta(u,v) ) = f(\sss (u,v)) \,, 
\quad \forall \, (u,v) \in U \,.
$${#eq-function-transition}
Let $\vv \in T_{\pp} \SSS$ and denote by $(\lambda,\mu)$ the components of $\vv$ with respect to the basis $\{\sssu,\sssv\}$ of $T_{\pp} \SSS$, that is,
$$
\vv = \lambda \sss_u + \mu \sss_v \,.
$$
Define the scalar functions
$$
u(t):= u_0 +\lambda t \,, \quad 
v(t):= v_0 +\mu t \,.
$$
Since $U$ is open in $\R^2$, and $(u_0,v_0) \in U$, there exists a sufficiently small $\e>0$ such that
$$
(u(t), v(t)) \in U \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (-\e,\e) \,.
$$
In particular, it is well defined the curve
$$
\g \colon (-\e,\e) \to \SSS \,, \quad \g(t) := \sss(u(t), v(t)) \,.
$$
It is immediate to check that
$$
\g(0) = \sss(u_0, v_0) = \pp  \,, \quad 
\dg(0) = \lambda \sssu+\mu \sssv = \vv \,.
$$
By definition of $\g$, and by (@eq-function-transition), we have
\begin{align*}
(f \circ \g)(t) & = f(\g(t)) \\
                & = f( \sss(u(t), v(t)) ) \\
                & = \widetilde{\sss} ( \alpha(u(t),v(t)), \beta(u(t),v(t))  ) \,.
\end{align*}
By chain rule we obtain
\begin{align*}
(f \circ \g)'(t) & = \widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde{u}} \frac{d}{dt}  \left[ \alpha(u(t),v(t)) \right] +
\widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde{v}} \frac{d}{dt}  \left[  \beta(u(t),v(t)) \right]   \\
& = \widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde{u}} \left[ \alpha_u \dot{u}(t) + \alpha_v \dot{v}(t)  \right] + 
\widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde{v}} \left[ \beta_u \dot{u}(t) + \beta_v \dot{v}(t)  \right] \,.
\end{align*}
Noting that 
$$
\dot{u}(0) = \lambda \,, \qquad \dot{v}(0) = \mu \,,
$$
we get
$$
(f \circ \g)'(0) = 
\widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde{u}} \left[ \lambda \alpha_u + \mu \alpha_v  \right] + 
\widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde{v}} \left[ \lambda  \beta_u + \mu \beta_v \right] \,.
$$
As, by definition of differential,
$$
d_{\pp} f (\vv)  = ( f \circ \g )' (0)\,,
$$
we have obtained 
$$
d_{\pp} f (\vv) = \widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde{u}} [ \lambda \alpha_u + \mu \alpha_v  ] + 
\widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde{v}} [ \lambda  \beta_u + \mu \beta_v]
$${#eq-function-transition-1}
We can now prove the 3 points stated in the Proposition:

1. The RHS of (@eq-function-transition-1) depends only on $\lambda,\mu$ (the components of $\vv$), $f$ (via the components $\alpha,\beta$ of $\Psi$), and the point $\pp$. In particular $d_{\pp}f(\vv)$ does not depend on the choice of $\g$, and the definition is well-posed.

2. The RHS of (@eq-function-transition-1) is linear in the components $\lambda,\mu$ of $\vv$. In particular $d_{\pp}f(\vv)$ is linear in $\vv$.

3. The coordinates of $\sssu$ with respect to the basis $\{\sssu,\sssv\}$ of $T_{\pp} \SSS$ are 
$$
(\lambda,\mu) = (1,0)\,.
$$
Using (@eq-function-transition-1), we get
$$
d_{\pp}f(\sssu) = \widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde{u}}\alpha_u + 
\widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde{v}} \beta_u 
$$
Similarly, the coordinates of $\sssv$ with respect to the basis $\{\sssu,\sssv\}$ of $T_{\pp} \SSS$ are 
$$
(\lambda,\mu) = (0,1) \,.
$$
Therefore
$$
d_{\pp}f(\sssv) = \widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde{u}}\alpha_v + 
\widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde{v}} \beta_v 
$$ 
This shows that the matrix of the linear application $d_{\pp}f$ with respect to the basis $\{\sssu,\sssv\}$ on $T_{\pp} \SSS$, and the basis $\{\widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde{u}} , \widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde{v}}\}$ on $T_{f(\pp)} \widetilde{\SSS}$, is given by
$$
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
\alpha_u & \alpha_v \\
\beta_u & \beta_v \\
\end{array}
\right) = J\Psi  \,.
$$
:::

Given the above discussion, we have 2 ways of computing the differential of a smooth function
$$
f \colon \SSS \to \wSSS
$$

1. **By using the definition:** Let $\vv \in T_{\pp} \SSS$ and let $\g$ be a curve on $\SSS$ such that 
$$
\g(0) = \pp \,, \quad \dg(0) = \vv \,.
$$
Then 
$$
d_{\pp} f (\vv) = (f \circ \g)'(0)\,.
$$
Method to construct $\g$: Following the proof of Proposition \ref{proposition-differential-smooth}, one can proceed as follows: 
    - Find $\sss \colon U \to \SSS$ chart of $\SSS$ at $\pp$.
    - Compute 
    $$
    T_{\pp} \SSS = \operatorname{span} \{ \sssu,\sssv \} \,.
    $$
    - For $\vv \in T_{\pp} \SSS$, compute $\lambda,\mu$ such that
    $$
    \vv = \lambda \sssu + \mu \sssv \,.
    $$
    - Compute $(u_0,v_0) = \sss^{-1}(\pp)$.
    - Define the curve
    $$
    \g(t) = \sss( u_0 + \lambda t, v_0 + \mu t ) \,.
    $$
    Such curve satisfies
    $$
    \g(0) = \pp \,, \qquad \dg(0) = \vv \,.
    $$
    - Compute 
    $$
    d_{\pp} f (\vv) = (f \circ \g)'(0)\,.
    $$

2. **By using the matrix representation:** Let $\vv \in T_{\pp} \SSS$
    - Find $\sss \colon U \to \SSS$ chart of $\SSS$ at $\pp$.
    - Find $\wsss \colon \wU \to \wSSS$ chart of $\wSSS$ at $f(\pp)$. 
    - Compute the components $\alpha,\beta$ of the function
    $$
    \wsss^{-1} \circ f \circ \sss \colon U \to \wU \,.
    $$
    - The matrix of $d_{\pp}f$ with respect to the basis $\{\sss_u,\sss_v\}$ on $T_{\pp} \SSS$, and the basis $\{\wsssu,\wsssv\}$ on $T_{\pp} \wSSS$, is given by 
    $$
    d_{\pp} f = J\Psi = 
    \left(
    \begin{array}{cc}
    \alpha_u & \alpha_v \\
    \beta_u & \beta_v \\
    \end{array}
    \right) \,.
    $$
    - Compute $\lambda,\mu$ such that
    $$
    \vv = \lambda \sssu + \mu \sssv \,.
    $$
    - Compute 
    $$
    d_{\pp} f (\vv) = \left(
    \begin{array}{cc}
    \alpha_u & \alpha_v \\
    \beta_u & \beta_v \\
    \end{array}
    \right) 
    \left(
    \begin{array}{c}
    \lambda \\
    \mu \\
    \end{array}
    \right) \,.
    $$


Let us give example calculations for both methods.

::: Example
### Computing $d_{\pp}f$ using the definition

Consider the portion of the plane $\{z=0\}$,
$$
\SSS = \left\{ (x,y,0) \in \R^3 \, \colon \, x \in (0,2\pi)\,, \, y \in  \R \right\} \,,
$$ 
and the unit cylinder
$$
\widetilde{\SSS} = \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \, \colon \, x^2 + y^2 = 1 \}  \,.
$$
Define the map 
$$
f \colon S \to \widetilde{\SSS} \,, \quad 
f(x,y,0) := (\cos x , \sin x, y) \,.
$$
The differential $d_{\pp}f$ at
$$
\pp = (u_0,v_0,0) \,, \quad \vv = (\lambda,\mu,0) \,,
$$
is given by
$$
d_{\pp} f (\vv) = (f \circ \g)' (0) =  (- \lambda \sin (u_0), \lambda \cos (u_0), \mu) \,.
$$

*Solution.* First, notice that $f$ is well defined, because 
$$
\cos^2(x) + \sin^2(x) = 1 \quad \implies \quad f \in \widetilde{\SSS} \,.
$$
We want to compute the differential of $f$
$$
d_{\pp} f \colon T_{\pp} \SSS \to T_{f(\pp)} \widetilde{\SSS}\,,
$$
where
$$
\pp = (u_0,v_0,0) \in \SSS \,.
$$
First, we need to compute $T_{\pp} \SSS$. To this end, a chart for $\SSS$ is given by
$$
\sss(u,v) = (u,v,0) \,.
$$
Therefore 
$$
\sss_u = (1,0,0) \,, \qquad \sss_v = (0,1,0) \,, 
$$
from which
\begin{align*}
T_{\pp} \SSS & = \operatorname{span} \{ \sss_u,\sss_v \} \\
             & = \operatorname{span} \{ (1,0,0), (0,1,0)  \} \\
             & = \{ (\lambda,\mu,0) \, \colon \, \lambda,\mu \in \R \} \,.
\end{align*}
Therefore, let 
$$
\vv = (\lambda,\mu,0) \in T_{\pp} \SSS \,. 
$$
We need to find a curve $\g \colon (-\e,\e) \to \SSS$ such that
$$
\g(0) = \pp \,, \quad \dg(0) = \vv = (\lambda,\mu,0)\,.
$${#eq-example-differential}
Define $\g$ by setting
$$
\g(t) := \sss(u_0 + t \lambda, v_0 + t \mu ) = (u_0 + t \lambda, v_0 + t \mu, 0)\,.
$$
Clearly, $\g$ satisfies (@eq-example-differential). We have
\begin{align*}
(f \circ \g) (t) & = f(u_0 + t \lambda, v_0 + t \mu,0) \\
                 & = ( \cos(u_0 + t \lambda), \sin(u_0 + t \lambda),v_0 + t \mu ) \,,\\
(f \circ \g)' (t) & = (- \lambda \sin (u_0 + t\lambda), \lambda \cos (u_0 + t \lambda), \mu) \,.
\end{align*}
Therefore, the differential $d_{\pp}f$ at
$$
\pp = (u_0,v_0,0) \,, \quad \vv = (\lambda,\mu,0) \,,
$$
is given by
$$
d_{\pp} f (\vv) = (f \circ \g)' (0) =  (- \lambda \sin (u_0), \lambda \cos (u_0), \mu) \,.
$$

::: Example
### Computing the matrix of $d_{\pp}f$

Consider the unit cylinder 
$$
\SSS = \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \, \colon \, x^2 + y^2 = 1 \} \,,
$$
and the plane
$$
\wSSS = \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \, \colon \, z = 0  \} \,.
$$
Define the map
$$
f \colon \SSS \to \wSSS \,, \quad 
f(x,y,z) = (y,xz,0) \,.
$$
Give charts of $\SSS$ and $\wSSS$, and compute the matrix of $d_{\pp} f$ with respect to these charts.

*Solution.* A chart of the cylinder $\SSS$ is given by 
$$
\sss(u,v) = (\cos u, \sin u, v) \,, \quad (u,v) \in U := (0,2\pi) \times \R \,.
$$
A chart of the plane $\widetilde{\SSS}$ is given by 
$$
\widetilde{\sss}(u,v) = (u,v,0) \,, \quad (u,v) \in \wU = \R^2 \,.
$$
We need to compute the map
$$
\Psi \colon U \to \widetilde{U} \,, \quad \Psi := \widetilde{\sss}^{-1} \circ f \circ \sss \,.
$$
Clearly we have
$$
\widetilde{\sss}^{-1} (u,v,0) =(u,v) \,.
$$
Therefore
\begin{align*}
\Psi(u,v) & = \widetilde{\sss}^{-1} \left( f(\sss(u,v))    \right) \\
          & = \widetilde{\sss}^{-1} \left( f(\cos u, \sin u, v )    \right) \\
          & =  \widetilde{\sss}^{-1} \left( \sin (u), \cos (u) v, 0    \right) \\
          & = \left( \sin (u), \cos (u) v    \right) \,.
\end{align*}
The components of $\Psi$ are
$$
\alpha(u,v) = \sin(u) \,, \qquad \beta (u,v) =  \cos (u) v  \,.
$$
Therefore 
\begin{align*}
\alpha_u & = \cos (u) \,, & \alpha_v &  = 0 \\
\beta_u  & = -\sin (u) v \,,  & \beta_v &  = \cos(u) 
\end{align*}
The matrix of $d_{\pp}f$ is hence
$$
d_{\pp}f = J\Psi = 
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
\cos (u) & 0 \\
-\sin (u) v  & \cos(u) \\
\end{array}
\right) \,.
$$

The differential satisfies the following useful properties.

The following hold:

1. If $\SSS$ is a regular surface and $\pp \in \SSS$, the differential at $\pp$ of the identity map 
$$
I \colon \SSS \to \SSS \,, \quad I(\xx):=\xx \,,
$$
is the identity map
$$
I \colon T_{\pp} (\SSS) \to T_{\pp} (\SSS) \,, \quad I(\vv):=\vv \,.

3. If $\SSS_1$, $\SSS_2$ are regular surfaces and 
$$
f \colon \SSS_1 \to \SSS_2 \,,

is a diffeomorphism, then the differential
$$

is invertible for all $\pp \in \SSS_1$.

1. $f$ is a local diffeomorphism at $\pp$.
2. The differential $d_{\pp} f \colon T_{\pp} \SSS_1 \to T_{f(\pp)} \SSS_2$ is invertible at $\pp$.

## Examples of Surfaces

In this section we discuss a few families of surfaces:

1. Level surfaces
2. Quadrics
3. Rules surfaces
4. Surfaces of revolution



### Level surfaces

Level surfaces are described as the set of zeros of scalar functions.

::: Definition
### Level surface

Let $V \subseteq \R^3$ be an open set and $f \colon V \to \R$ be smooth. The **level surface** associated with $f$ is the set
$$
\SSS_f := f^{-1}(0) = \{ (x,y,z) \in V \divider f(x,y,z) = 0  \} \,.

We now give a result concerning regularity of level surfaces. The proof, rather technical, is based on the Implicit Function Theorem. It can be
found in Proposition 3.1.25 of [@abate-tovena]. We decide to omit it.

\nabla f (x,y,z) \neq 0 \,, \quad \forall \, (x,y,z) \in V \,.

::: Example
### Circular cone

We saw that the circular cone
$$
\SSS := \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider x^2 + y^2 = z^2  \} 
$$
is not a surface. However, the positive sheet 
$$
\SSS^+ := \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider x^2 + y^2 = z^2 \,, \,  z>0  \} \,.
$$
is a regular surface, see @fig-positive-cone, with regular atlas given by $\mathcal{A} = \{\sss\}$, where 
$$
\sss \colon \R^2 \to \R^3 \,, \quad 
\sss (u,v) = (u,v,\sqrt{u^2 + v^2}) \,.
$$
Use Theorem \ref{theorem-level-surface} to show that $\SSS^+$ is a regular surface.


*Solution.* Define the open set 
$$
V := \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider z > 0 \} \,,
$$
and the function $f \colon V \to \R$ by
$$
f(x,y,z) := x^2 + y^2 - z^2 \,.
$$
We have
$$
\nabla f (x,y,z) = ( 2x, 2y, -2z ) \neq 0  \,, \quad 
\forall \, (x,y,z) \in V \,.
$$
Since 
$$
\SSS^+ = \SSS_f \,,
$$
by Theorem \ref{theorem-level-surface} we conclude that 
$\SSS$ is a regular surface.

Let us give a characterization of the tangent plane to level surfaces.


::: Proposition
### Tangent plane of level surfaces

Let $V \subseteq \R^3$ be an open set and $f \colon V \to \R$ be smooth. 
Suppose that 
$$
\nabla f (x,y,z) \neq 0 \,, \quad \forall \, (x,y,z) \in V \,.
$$
Let $\pp \in \SSS_f$. We have
$$
\nabla f(\pp) \perp T_{\pp} \SSS_f \,.
$$ 
In particular, they hold:

1. The cartesian equation of $T_{\pp} \SSS_f$ is given by
$$
\nabla f (\pp) \cdot \xx = 0    \,, \quad  \forall  \, \xx \in \R^3\,,
$$

2. The cartesian equation for $\pp + T_{\pp} \SSS_f$ is given by
$$
\nabla f(\pp) \cdot (\xx- \pp) = 0 \,, \quad \forall \, \xx \in \R^3\,.
$$

:::

::: Proof

Let $\vv \in T_{\pp} \SSS_f$. By definition of tangent plane, there exists a smooth curve 
$$
\g \colon (-\e,\e) \to \SSS_f
$$
such that
$$
\g(0) = \pp \,, \quad \dg(0)=\vv \,.
$$
Since $\g(t) \in \SSS_f$, we have that
$$
f(\g(t)) = 0 \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (-\e,\e) \,.
$$
By chain rule we get
$$
\nabla f (\g(t)) \cdot \dg(t) = 0 \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (-\e,\e) \,.
$$
Evaluating the above at $t=0$ yields
$$
0 = \nabla f (\g(0)) \cdot \dg(0) = \nabla f (\pp) \cdot \vv \,,
$$
showing that $\vv$ is orthogonal to $\nabla f (\pp)$. Since $\vv$ is arbitrary, we conclude that 
$$
\nabla f (\pp) \perp T_{\pp} \SSS_f \,.
$$
In particular, the equation for $T_{\pp} \SSS_f$ is
$$
\nabla f(\pp) \cdot \xx= 0 \,, \quad \forall \, \xx \in \R^3 \,.
$$
Therefore, the equation for $\pp + T_{\pp} \SSS$ is given by
$$
\nabla f(\pp) \cdot \xx = k \,, \quad \forall \, \xx \in \R^3 \,,
$$
for some $k \in \R$. Since $\pp$ belongs to $\pp + T_{\pp} \SSS$, we can substitute $\pp$ in the above equation to obtain
$$
k = \nabla f(\pp) \cdot \pp \,.
$$
Hence the equation for $\pp + T_{\pp} \SSS$ is
$$
\nabla f(\pp) \cdot (\xx - \pp) = 0 \,, \quad \forall \, \xx \in \R^3 \,.
$$

::: Example
## Unit cylinder

Consider the unit cylinder 
$$
\SSS = \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider x^2 + y^2 = 1 \}   \,.
$$

1. Use Theorem \ref{theorem-level-surface} to prove that $\SSS$ is a regular surface. 
2. Let 
$$
\pp = \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},5 \right) \in \SSS
$$
Show that $T_{\pp} \SSS$ has cartesian equation 
$$
x + y = 0 \,.
$$


*Solution.* 

1. From Example \ref{example-unit-cylinder}, we already know that $\SSS$ is a regular surface. Let us prove that $\SSS$ is regular by using Theorem \ref{theorem-level-surface}. To this end, define the open set
$$
V := \R^3 \smallsetminus \{ (0,0,z) \divider z \in \R \} \,.
$$
Note that $V$ is obtained by removing the $z$-axis from $\R^3$. Also define  the function $f \colon \R^3 \to \R$ by
$$
f(x,y,z) := x^2 + y^2 -1 \,.
$$
We have
$$
\nabla f (x,y,z) = ( 2x, 2y, 0 ) \neq 0  \,, \quad 
\forall \, (x,y,z) \in V \,.
$$
Since 
$$
\SSS = \SSS_f \,,
$$
by Theorem \ref{theorem-level-surface} we conclude that 
$\SSS$ is a regular surface.

2. Using the expression for $\nabla f$ found in Point 1, we get
$$
\nabla f (\pp) = \nabla f \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},5 \right) = 
(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{2},0) \,.
$$
The equation for $T_{\pp} \SSS$ is
$$
\nabla f (\pp) \cdot \xx = 0 \,, \quad \forall \, \xx \in \R^3 \,.
$$
Therefore, we find
\begin{align*}
\nabla f (\pp) \cdot \xx = 0 \,\, & \iff \,\,
(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{2},0) \cdot (x,y,z) = 0 \\ 
\,\, & \iff \,\, 
x + y = 0 \,.

### Quadrics


Quadrics are special level surfaces
$$
S_f = \left\{  (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider f(x,y,z) = 0   \right\} \,,
$$
where
\begin{align*}
f(x,y,z)  = & a_1 x^2 + a_2 y^2 + a_3 z^2 + 2a_4 xy + 2a_5 xz + 2a_6 yz + \\
          & + b_1 x + b_2 y + b_3 z + c  \,,
\end{align*}
for some coefficients $a_i,b_i,c \in \R$. Let
$$
A =  
\left( 
\begin{array}{ccc}
a_1 & a_4 & a_6 \\
a_4 & a_2 & a_5 \\
a_6 & a_5 & a_3 
\end{array}
\right)  \in \R^{3 \times 3} \,,
$$
and
$$
\xx = (x,y,z)^T \,, \quad \mathbf{b} = (b_1,b_2,b_3)^T \,.
$$
Then $f$ can be represented by the quadratic form
$$
f(\xx) = \xx^T A \xx + \mathbf{b} \cdot \xx + c \,.
$$
The expression $f=0$ is called a **quadric equation**.


As stated in the following Theorem, there are $14$ quadrics in total. Out of these:

- 9 are *interesting* surfaces, 
- 3 are planes,
- 1 is a line,
- 1 is a point.



::: {.Theorem #theorem-quadrics}

Suppose $\SSS$ is a level surface defined by a quadric equation. 
Then, up to rigid motions, $\SSS$ can be described by one of the following equations:

1. Ellipsoid: $\dfrac{x^2}{p^2} + \dfrac{y^2}{q^2} + \dfrac{z^2}{r^2} = 1$.

2. Hyperboloid of one sheet: $\dfrac{x^2}{p^2} + \dfrac{y^2}{q^2} - \dfrac{z^2}{r^2} = 1$

3. Hyperboloid of two sheets: $\dfrac{x^2}{p^2} - \dfrac{y^2}{q^2} - \dfrac{z^2}{r^2} = 1$

4. Elliptic Paraboloid: $\dfrac{x^2}{p^2} + \dfrac{y^2}{q^2}  = z$

5. Hyperbolic Paraboloid: $\dfrac{x^2}{p^2} - \dfrac{y^2}{q^2}  = z$

6. Quadric Cone: $\dfrac{x^2}{p^2} + \dfrac{y^2}{q^2} - \dfrac{z^2}{r^2} = 0$

7. Elliptic Cylinder: $\dfrac{x^2}{p^2} + \dfrac{y^2}{q^2}  = 1$

8. Hyperbolic Cylinder: $\dfrac{x^2}{p^2} - \dfrac{y^2}{q^2}  = 1$

9. Parabolic Cylinder: $\dfrac{x^2}{p^2} = y$

10. Plane: $x = 0$

11. Two parallel planes: $x^2 = p^2$

12. Two intersecting planes: $\dfrac{x^2}{p^2} - \dfrac{y^2}{q^2} = 0$

13. Straight line: $\dfrac{x^2}{p^2} + \dfrac{y^2}{q^2} = 0$

14. Single point: $\dfrac{x^2}{p^2} + \dfrac{y^2}{q^2} + \dfrac{z^2}{r^2} = 0$

The proof of Theorem \ref{theorem-quadrics} follows (quite tediously) by diagonalizing 
the symmetric matrix $A$, and by studying the eigenvalues, see Theorem 5.5.2 in [@pressley].

::: Example

The sphere is described by
$$
S = \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 \} \,.
$$
This is an ellipsoid with 
$$
p = q = r = 1 \,.
$$
In particular we can write the sphere as the quadric equation:
$$
\xx^T 
\left( 
\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 
\end{array}
\right)  \xx = 1 \,.
$$

::: Example

Consider the level surface
$$
\SSS =   \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider f(x,y,z) = 0 \}
$$
with 
$$
f(x,y,z) = x^2 + 2y^2 - 4z^2 + 2xy + yz - 6xz + 1 = 0 \,.
$$
Therefore $\SSS$ is a quadric. The matrix associated to $f$ is
$$
A =  
\left( 
\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 1 & -3 \\
1 & 2 & 1/2 \\
-3 & 1/2 & -4

Diagonalizing the matrix $A$ we obtain $A=PDP^{-1}$, with $P$ matrix of
eigenvectors and 
$$
D =  
\left( 
\begin{array}{ccc}
-5.51 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1.55 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 2.96 
\end{array}
\right)  \,.
$$
Therefore, up to changing basis via the matrix $P$, the surface $S$ can be described 
by the quadric equation
$$
5.51 \widetilde{x}^2 - 1.55 \widetilde{y}^2 - 2.96 \widetilde{z}^2 = 1  \,,
$$
showing that $S$ is a Hyperboloid of two sheets.

### Ruled surfaces


A ruled surface, is a surface obtained as union of straight lines, called the rulings of the surface. By using curves, ruled surfaces can be defined
in the following way.


::: Definition
### Ruled surface

A **ruled surface** is a surface with 
chart
$$
\sss(u,v) = \g(u) + v \mathbf{a}(u) \,,
$$
where

1. $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ is a smooth curve,
2. $\mathbf{a} \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ is a smooth curve,
3. $\dg(t)$ and $\mathbf{a}(t)$ are linearly independent for all $t \in (a,b)$. 

We say that:

1. $\g$ is the **base curve**.
2. The lines $v \mapsto v \mathbf{a}(u)$ are the **rulings**.

:::


::: Proposition

A ruled surface $\SSS$ is regular if $v$ is sufficiently small.

:::

::: Proof

A chart for $\SSS$ is
$$
\sss(u,v) = \g(u) + v \mathbf{a}(u) \,,
$$
with $\dg$ and $\mathbf{a}$ linerly independent Differentiating, we obtain
$$
\sss_u = \dg(u) + v \dot{\mathbf{a}}(u) \,, \quad
\sss_v = \mathbf{a}(u) \,.
$$
Thus, $\dg(u) + v \dot{\mathbf{a}}(u)$ and $\mathbf{a}$ are linearly independent for
$v$ sufficiently small. 

:::


The same base curve can yield multiple ruled surfaces, depending on the choice of rulings. For example, if $\g$ is a circle, 
$$
\g(u) = (\cos(u), \sin(u), 0) \,,
$$
we can obtain both the unit cylinder, and the MÃ¶bius band. 


::: Example
### Unit Cylinder

Consider the unit cylinder 
$$
\SSS = \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \, \colon \, x^2 + y^2 = 1 \} \,.
$$
As seen in Example \ref{example-unit-cylinder}, $\SSS$ is a surface with atlas $\mathcal{A}=\{\sss_1,\sss_2\}$, where $\sss_1$ and $\sss_2$ are suitable restriction of
$$
\sss (u,v) = (\cos(u), \cos(u),v ) \,, \quad (u,v) \in [0,2\pi) \times \R \,.
$$
Equivalently, we can rewrite $\sss$ as
$$
\sss(u,v) = \g(u) + v \mathbf{a}(u) \,,
$$
with
$$
\g(u):= (\cos(u), \cos(u),0 ) \,, \quad \mathbf{a} = (0,0,1) \,.
$$
Note that the vectors
$$
\dg = (-\sin(u), \cos(u), 0 ) \,, \quad \mathbf{a} = (0,0,1)
$$
are orthogonal, and hence linearly independent. Therefore $\SSS$ is a ruled surface, see @fig-cylinder-ruled.

:::


![The unit cylinder is a ruled surface with base curve the unit circle, and rulings given by vertical lines.](/images/surfaces_ruled.png){#fig-cylinder-ruled width=70%}


::: Example
### MÃ¶bius band  {#example-mobius}

The MÃ¶bius band is a ruled surface with chart
$$
\sss = \g(u) + v \mathbf{a}(u) \,, \quad u \in (0,2\pi), \, v \in \left( -\frac12, \frac12 \right) \,,
$$
where 
$$
\g(u) = (\cos(u), \sin(u), 0) 
$$
is the unit circle, and
$$
\mathbf{a} = \left(   -\sin \left( \frac{u}{2} \right) \cos(u),
                  -\sin \left( \frac{u}{2} \right) \sin(u),
                   \cos \left( \frac{u}{2} \right)   \right) 
$$
is a vector which does a full rotation while going around the unit
circle $\g$. This is shown in @fig-mobius-ruled. In particular 
$$
\sss (u,v) =  \left(   
  \left[ 1 - v \sin \left( \frac{u}{2} \right) \right] \cos(u),
  \left[ 1 - v \sin \left( \frac{u}{2} \right) \right] \sin(u),
  v \cos \left( \frac{u}{2} \right)   \right) \,.
$$

We want to prove that $\SSS$ is **non orientable**. From the above formula for $\sss$, it is easy to compute that 
$$
\sssu \times \sssv = \left( - \cos(u) \cos \left(  \frac{u}{2} \right),   - \sin(u) \cos \left(  \frac{u}{2} \right) , - \sin \left(  \frac{u}{2} \right) \right) \,.
$$
It is also immediate to check that $\norm{\sssu \times \sssv} = 1$, and therefore the principal unit normal of $\sss$ is
$$
\NN_{\sss} = \sss_u \times \sssv \,.
$$
Suppose by contradiction that $\SSS$ is orientable. This means there exists a globally defined principal unit normal vector
$$
\NN \colon \SSS \to \R^3 \,.
$$
By definition of principal normal, we have either 
$$
\NN \circ \sss = \NN_{\sss} \quad \text{ or } \quad
\NN \circ \sss = - \NN_{\sss} \,.
$$
Without loss of generality assume that 
$$
\NN \circ \sss = \NN_{\sss} \,.
$$
Consider the point $\pp = (1,0,0)$ on $\SSS$. Notice that, by continuity, $\pp$ can be obtained via $\sss$ through the limits
$$
\pp = \lim_{u \to 0^+} \sss(u,0) = \lim_{u \to 2\pi^-} \sss(u,0) \,.
$$
Since $\NN$ is continuous, the above implies
$$
\NN(\pp) = \lim_{u \to 0^+} \NN \circ \sss(u,0) = \lim_{u \to 2\pi^-} \NN \circ \sss(u,0) \,.
$${#eq-mobius-not-orientable}
However, by direct calculation:
\begin{align*}
\lim_{u \to 0^+} \NN \circ \sss(u,0) & =
\lim_{u \to 0^+} \NN_{\sss} (u,0) = (-1,0,0) \\
\lim_{u \to 2\pi^-} \NN \circ \sss(u,0) & =
\lim_{u \to 2\pi^-} \NN_{\sss} (u,0) = (1,0,0)
\end{align*}
This clearly contradicts (@eq-mobius-not-orientable). Therefore $\NN$ cannot exist, and $\SSS$ is not orientable.

### Surfaces of Revolution


Surfaces of revolution are obtained by rotating a curve about the $z$-axis.


::: Definition
### Surface of revolution

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be a smooth curve in the $(x,z)$-plane, that is,
$$
\g(v) = (f(v), 0 , g(v)) \,.
$$
Suppose that $f>0$. The surface obtained by rotating $\g$ about the $z$-axis is called **surface of revolution**. A chart for $\SSS$ is given by
$$
\sss (u,v) :=  (\cos(u)f(v) , \sin(u) f(v), g(v))\,,
$$
with $u \in [0,2\pi)$ and $v \in (a,b)$.

:::


::: {.Proposition #proposition-revolution}

A surface of revolution is regular if and only if $\g$ is regular.

:::


::: Proof

We have
\begin{align*}
\sss_u & = \left(- \sin(u)f(v),  \cos(u) f(v), 0 \right) \,, \\
\sss_v & = \left(\cos(u) \dot{f}(v) , \sin(u)\dot{f}(v) , \dot{g}(v) \right) \,.
\end{align*}
Therefore
$$
\sss_u \times \sss_v = \left( \cos(u) f \dot{g} ,  \sin(u) f \dot{g} , -f \dot{f} \right) \,,
$$
and 
$$
\norm{\sss_u \times \sss_v}^2 = f^2 \left( \dot{f}^2 + \dot{g}^2 \right) = f^2 \norm{\g}^2 \,.
$$
Recall that $f > 0$ by definition, so that $f^2 \neq 0$. 
Therefore $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ are linearly independent if and only if $\g$ is regular.

:::



::: Example
### Catenoid

The Catenoid is the surface of revolution obtained by rotating the catenary about the $z$-axis, see @fig-catenoid. Recall that the catenary function is defined by
$$
f(v) = \cosh (v) \,.  
$$
Therefore the catenoid is obtained by rotating 
$$
\g(v) = \left(  \cosh (v), 0 , v \right) \,.
$$
A chart for the catenoid is given by
$$
\sss (u,v) = (\cos(u) \cosh (v) , \sin(u) \cosh (v), v) \,, 
$$
where $u \in [0,2\pi)$ and $v \in \R$. Note that $f>0$ and 
$$
\dg = \left(  \sinh (v), 0 , 1 \right) \,, \quad 
\norm{\dg}^2 = 1+ \sinh(v)^2 \geq 1 \,.
$$
Therefore $\g$ is regular. By Proposition \ref{proposition-revolution}, we  conclude that the Catenoid is a regular surface.

## First fundamental form


In this section we introduce the first **fundamental form** of a surface. This will allow us to compute:

- Angle between tangent vectors
- Lengths of tangent vectors
- Area of surface regions





### Definition of FFF

Let $\SSS$ be a surface and consider two points $\pp, \mathbf{q} \in \SSS$. The euclidean distance between $\pp$ and $\mathbf{q}$ is 
$$
\norm{\pp - \mathbf{q}} \,.
$$
However, this measures the length of the straight segment which connects $\pp$ to $\mathbf{q}$, that is, the planar distance between $\pp$ and $\mathbf{q}$. We are interested in measuring the distance of $\pp$ and $\mathbf{q}$ on $\SSS$.
A way to measure such distance is the following: Suppose 
$$
\g \colon (a,b) \to \SSS
$$ 
is a smooth curve such that
$$
\g(a) = \pp\,, \quad \g(b) = \mathbf{q} \,.
$$
The distance between $\pp$ and $\mathbf{q}$ on $\SSS$ could be defined as the length of $\g$, i.e.,
$$
\int_{a}^{b} \norm{ \dg (t) } \, dt \,.
$$
Since $\g(t) \in \SSS$, by definition of tangent plane, we have
$$
\dg(t) \in T_{\pp} S \,, \quad \pp := \g(t) \,.
$$
Therefore, computing $\norm{\dg(t)}$ is equivalent
to computing the length of tangent vectors to $\SSS$. This motivates the definition of first fundamental form.


::: Definition
### First fundamental form

Let $\SSS$ be a regular surface and $\pp \in \SSS$. The 
**first fundamental form** of $\SSS$ at $\pp$ is the bilinear symmetric map
$$
I_{\pp} \colon T_{\pp} \SSS \times T_{\pp} \SSS \to \R \,, \quad I_{\pp} (\vv,\ww) := \vv \cdot \ww \,.
$$


:::


Three observations:

1. The first fundamental form of $\SSS$ at $\pp$ is the map obtained by restricting the scalar product of $\R^3$ to $T_{\pp} \SSS$.

2. Note that 
$$
I_{\pp} (\vv,\vv) = \| \vv \|^2 \,,
$$
so that $I_{\pp}$ can be used to compute the length of tangent vectors.

3. The definition of $I_{\pp}$ does not depend on a chosen chart, since $T_{\pp}\SSS$ can be defined without using charts.


To use the first fundamental form in practice, we need to express $I_{\pp}$ in terms of local
charts. To this end, we first define:

- The coordinates functions $du$ and $dv$ on $T_{\pp} \SSS$,
- The first fundamental form of a chart.

::: Definition
### Coordinate functions on tangent plane  {#definition-coordinate-functions}

Let $\sss \colon U \to \R^3$ be a regular chart of $\SSS$. 
For each $\pp \in \sss(U)$ we have
$$
T_{\pp} \SSS = \operatorname{span} \{\sss_u,\sss_v\} \,,
$$
where $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ are evaluated at the point $(u,v) \in U$ such that 
$$
\sss(u,v)=\pp \,.
$$
Therefore, for each $\vv \in T_{\pp} \SSS$, there exist $\lambda,\mu \in \R$ such that
$$
\vv = \lambda \sss_u + \mu \sss_v \,.
$$
The **coordinate functions** on $T_{\pp} \SSS$ are the linear maps

### First fundamental form of a chart

Let $\sss \colon U \to \R^3$ be a regular chart of $\SSS$. Define the functions
$$
E , F , G \colon U \to \R 
$$
by setting
$$
E := \sss_u \cdot \sss_u \,, \quad  F := \sss_u \cdot \sss_v \,, \quad 
G := \sss_v \cdot \sss_v \,.
$$
The **first fundamental form** of $\sss$ is the quadratic form
$$
\mathscr{F}_1 \colon T_{\pp} \SSS \to \R
$$
defined by
$$
\mathscr{F}_1 (\vv) := E \, du^2(\vv) + 2F \, du(\vv) \, dv (\vv)+ G \, dv^2 (\vv) \,,
$${#eq-fff-chart}
for all $\vv \in T_{\pp} \SSS$, and $\pp \in \sss(U)$, where $E,F,G$ are evaluated at 
$$
(u,v) = \sss^{-1}(\pp) \,.
$$

:::


We usually omit the dependence on $\vv$ in (@eq-fff-chart), and just write
$$
\mathscr{F}_1 = E \, du^2 + 2F \, du \, dv + G \, dv^2 \,. 
$$
We are now ready to write $I_{\pp}$ with respect to the basis $\{\sss_u,\sss_v\} $of $T_{\pp} \SSS$.



::: {.Proposition  #proposition-fff-quadratic}

Let $\sss \colon U \to \R^3$ be a regular chart of $\SSS$, and $\pp \in \sss(U)$. Then
$$
I_{\pp} (\vv,\ww) = (du (\vv), dv(\vv) )  \, 
\left( 
\begin{array}{cc}
E & F \\
F & G 
\end{array}
\right) \, (du(\ww) , dv(\ww))^T \,,
$$
for all $\vv,\ww \in T_{\pp} \SSS$. In particular, $\mathscr{F}_1$ is the quadratic form associated to the symmetric bilinear form $I_{\pp}$, that is,
$$
\mathscr{F}_1 (\vv) = I_{\pp} (\vv,\vv) \,, \quad \forall \, \vv \in T_{\pp} \SSS \,.
$$


:::

::: Proof

By Theorem \ref{theorem-tangent-plane}, we have
$$
T_{\pp} \SSS = \operatorname{span} \{ \sss_u, \sss_v \} \,.
$$
Therefore, for $\vv,\ww \in T_{\pp} \SSS$, there exist $\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\mu_1,\mu_2 \in \R$ such that 
$$
\vv = \lambda_1 \sss_u + \mu_1 \sss_v \,, \quad 
\ww = \lambda_2 \sss_u + \mu_2 \sss_v \,.
$$
Therefore,
\begin{align*}
I_{\pp} (\vv,\ww) & = \vv \cdot \ww \\
& = \lambda_1 \lambda_2 \, \sss_u \cdot \sss_v + ( \lambda_1 \mu_2 + \lambda_2 \mu_1 ) \, \sss_u \cdot \sss_v + \mu_1 \mu_2 \, \sss_v \cdot \sss_v \\
& = E \, du (\vv) du(\ww)  + F \, ( du(\vv) \, dv(\ww) + du(\ww) dv(\vv) ) \\
& \qquad  + G \,  dv(\vv) dv(\ww) \\
& = (du (\vv), dv(\vv) )  \, 
\left( 
\begin{array}{cc}
E & F \\
F & G 
\end{array}
\right) \, (du(\ww) , dv(\ww))^T \,.
\end{align*}
The fact that 
$$
I_{\pp}(\vv,\vv) = \mathscr{F}_1(\vv)
$$ 
follows from the first part of the 
statement and definition of $\mathscr{F}_1$.


:::



::: Remark
### Linear algebra interpretation 

Using linear algebra, Proposition \ref{proposition-fff-quadratic} has the following clear interpretation: $I_{\pp}$ is a symmetric bilinear form on the vector space $T_{\pp} \SSS$. 
Fixing the basis $\{ \sss_u, \sss_v \}$ for $T_{\pp} \SSS$, we can represent $I_{\pp}$ via the matrix
\begin{align*}
M & := 
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
I_{\pp} (\sss_u , \sss_u) & I_{\pp} (\sss_u , \sss_v) \\
I_{\pp} (\sss_v , \sss_u) & I_{\pp} (\sss_v , \sss_v) \\
\end{array}
\right) \\
& =
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
\sss_u \cdot \sss_u &  \sss_u \cdot \sss_v \\
\sss_v \cdot \sss_u &  \sss_v \cdot \sss_v \\
\end{array}
\right) \\
& =
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
E & F \\
F & G \\
\end{array}
\right) \,,
\end{align*}
where we used that $\sss_u \cdot \sss_v = \sss_v \cdot \sss_u$. 

:::



::: Notation

With a little abuse of notation, we also denote by $\mathscr{F}_1$ the $2 \times 2$ matrix
$$
\mathscr{F}_1 := 
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
E & F \\
F & G
\end{array}
\right) \,.
$$

:::





::: Remark
### First fundamental form and reparametrizations  {#remark-fff-reparametrization}

The first fundamental form $I_{\pp}$ depends only on the surface $\SSS$ and the point $\pp$. 
Instead the local representation of $I_{\pp}$
$$
\mathscr{F}_1 = E \, du^2 + 2F \, du dv + G \, dv^2 \,,
$$
depends on the choice of chart $\sss \colon U \to \R^3$. Indeed suppose that $\widetilde{\sss} \colon \widetilde{U} \to \R^3$ is a reparametrization of $\sss$, that is, 
$$
\widetilde{\sss} = \sss \circ \Phi \,,
$$
where $\Phi \colon \widetilde{U} \to U$ is a diffeomorphism. Recall the following notation: the components
$\Phi^1$ and $\Phi^2$ of $\Phi$ are denoted by
$$
(\tilde{u}, \tilde{v}) \mapsto u (\tilde{u}, \tilde{v}) \,, \quad 
(\tilde{u}, \tilde{v}) \mapsto v (\tilde{u}, \tilde{v}) \,,
$$
respectively. The Jacobian of $\Phi$ is then
$$
J\Phi = \left(   
\begin{array}{cc}
 \dfrac{\partial u}{\partial \tilde u}  &  \dfrac{\partial u}{\partial \tilde v}  \\
 \dfrac{\partial v}{\partial \tilde u}  &  \dfrac{\partial v}{\partial \tilde v}
\end{array}
\right) \,.
$$
Denote the first fundamental form of $\widetilde{\sss}$ by
$$
\widetilde{\mathscr{F}}_1 = \widetilde{E} \, d\tilde{u}^2 + 2 \widetilde{F} \, d\tilde{u} d\tilde{v} + \widetilde{G} \, d\tilde{v}^2 \,.
$$
The linear maps $du, dv$ and $d\tilde{u}, d\tilde{v}$ are related by
$$
du = \frac{\partial u}{\partial \tilde{u}} \, d\tilde{u} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial \tilde{v}} \, d\tilde{v} \,, \quad 
dv = \frac{\partial v}{\partial \tilde{u}} \, d\tilde{u} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial \tilde{v}} \, d\tilde{v} 
$${#eq-fff-change-basis-1}
Moreover the matrices of $\mathscr{F}_1$ and $\widetilde{\mathscr{F}}_1$ are related by
$$
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
\widetilde{E} & \widetilde{F} \\
\widetilde{F} & \widetilde{G}
\end{array}
\right)  
= 
(J \Phi)^T \,
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
E & F \\
F & G
\end{array}
\right)
\, 
J \Phi  \,.
$${#eq-fff-change-basis-2}

> The proof of the above statements follows by basic linear algebra: The pairs $\{\sss_u,\sss_u\}$ and $\{\widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde{u}} , \widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde{v}} \}$ are bases for the vector space $T_{\pp} \SSS$. By the chain rule, we have
\begin{align*}
\widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde{u}}  & = 
\sss_u  \frac{\partial u}{\partial \tilde{u}} + \sss_v  \frac{\partial v}{\partial \tilde{u}} \\ 
\widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde{v}}  & = 
\sss_u  \, \frac{\partial u}{\partial \tilde{v}}  + \sss_v  \frac{\partial v}{\partial \tilde{v}} 
\end{align*}
The above shows that the change of basis matrix between $\{\sss_u,\sss_u\}$ and $\{\widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde{u}} , \widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde{v}} \}$ is given exactly by $J\Phi$. Therefore, formulas (@eq-fff-change-basis-1) and (@eq-fff-change-basis-2) are consequence of change of basis results for linear maps and bilinear forms, respectively.

Let us compute the first fundamental form of a plane and of a cylinder.


::: Example
### Plane   {#example-fff-plane}

Let $\mathbf{a}, \pp, \mathbf{q} \in \R^3$, and suppose that $\pp$ and $\mathbf{q}$ are orthonormal vectors. Consider the plane with chart
$$
\sss(u,v) = \mathbf{a} + u \pp + v \mathbf{q} \,, \quad (u,v) \in \R^2 \,.
$$
Prove that the first fundamental form of $\sss$ is
$$
\mathscr{F}_1 = du^2 + dv^2 \,.
$$

*Solution*. We have
$$
\sss_u = \pp \,, \quad \sss_v = \mathbf{q} \,,
$$
and therefore, using that $\pp$ and $\mathbf{q}$ are orthonormal,
\begin{align*}
E & = \sss_u \cdot \sss_u = \norm{\pp}^2 = 1 \\
F & = \sss_u \cdot \sss_v = \pp \cdot \mathbf{q} = 0 \\
G & = \sss_v \cdot \sss_v = \norm{\mathbf{q}}^2 = 1 \\
\end{align*}
The first fundamental form of $\sss$ is, therefore
$$
\mathscr{F}_1 = E \, du^2 + 2 F\, du \, dv + G \, dv^2 = du^2 + dv^2 \,.  
$$

:::


::: Remark

In the simple case of Example \ref{example-fff-plane}, the first fundamental form is essentially the Pythagorean Theorem on the plane: In fact, a basis for $T_{\pp} \SSS$ is 
$$
T_{\pp}\SSS = \operatorname{span} \{ \sssu , \sssv \} = \{ \lambda \pp + \mu \mathbf{q} \, \colon \, \lambda, \mu \in \R \} \,.
$$
Therefore, for 
$$
\vv \in T_{\pp} \SSS \,, \qquad \vv = \lambda \pp + \mu \mathbf{q} \,,
$$
we have
$$
\| \vv \|^2 = \FF_1 (\vv) = du^2(\vv) +  dv^2(\vv) = \lambda^2 + \mu^2 \,.
$$
Hence, the square of the length of the vector $\vv$, which has coordinates $\lambda, \mu$ in the basis $\{ \sssu, \sssv \}$, is equal to $\lambda^2 + \mu^2$.

:::


::: Warning

 Changing parametrization can change the local form of $\FF_1$, as seen in the next two examples. This is not surprising, due to Remark \ref{remark-fff-reparametrization}.

:::



::: Example

If in Example \ref{example-fff-plane} we drop the assumption of $\pp$ and $\mathbf{q}$ being orthonormal, then 
$$
\mathscr{F}_1 = \norm{\pp}^2 \, du^2 + 2 \pp \cdot \mathbf{q} \, du \, dv + \norm{\mathbf{q}}^2 \, dv^2 \,.
$$

:::

::: Example
### Plane in polar coordinates   {#example-fff-plane-polar}

Let $\mathbf{a}, \pp, \mathbf{q} \in \R^3$, with $\pp, \mathbf{q}$ orthonormal. In polar coordinates, the plane is charted by
$$
\sss(r,\theta) = \mathbf{a} + r \cos(\theta) \pp + r \sin(\theta) \mathbf{q} \,, \quad r>0 , \, \theta \in (0,2\pi) \,.
$$
Prove that the first fundamental form of $\sss$ is
$$
\mathscr{F}_1 = dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2 \,.
$$

*Solution.* We have
\begin{align*}
\sss_r & = \cos(\theta)\pp + \sin(\theta) \mathbf{q} \\ 
\sss_{\theta} & = - r \sin(\theta) \pp + r \cos(\theta) \mathbf{q}
\end{align*}
and therefore 
\begin{align*}
E & = \sss_r \cdot \sss_r \\
    & = \cos^2(\theta)\norm{\pp}^2 + \sin^2(\theta)\norm{\mathbf{q}}^2 + 2 \cos(\theta) \sin(\theta) \pp \cdot \mathbf{q} \\
    & = 1 \\
F & = \sss_r \cdot \sss_{\theta} = 0 \\
G & = \sss_{\theta} \cdot \sss_{\theta} = r^2 \\
\end{align*}
Then the first fundamental form is
$$
\mathscr{F}_1 = E \, dr^2 + 2 F\, dr \, d\theta + G \, d\theta^2 = dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2 \,.  
$$

:::


::: Example
### Unit cylinder  {#example-cylinder-fff}

Consider the unit cylinder with chart
$$
\sss(u,v) = (\cos(u), \sin(u),  v)  \,, \quad (u,v) \in (0,2\pi) \times \R \,.
$$
Prove that the first fundamental form of $\sss$ is
$$
\mathscr{F}_1 = du^2 + dv^2 \,.
$$

*Solution.* We have
$$
\sss_u = (-\sin(u),\cos(u), 0 )  \,, \quad \sss_v = (0,0,1) \,, 
$$
and therefore 
\begin{align*}
E & = \sss_u \cdot \sss_u = 1 \\
F & = \sss_u \cdot \sss_v = 0 \\
G & = \sss_v \cdot \sss_v = 1 \\
\end{align*}
Then the first fundamental form is
$$
\mathscr{F}_1 = E \, du^2 + 2 F\, du \, dv + G \, dv^2 = du^2 + dv^2 \,.  
$$

:::


::: Remark

We have seen that a plane and the unit cylinder have the same first fundamental form 
$$
\mathscr{F}_1 = du^2 + dv^2 \,.
$$
Therefore, lengths, angles and areas are the same on the two surfaces.

:::






### Length of curves


The first fundamental form allows to compute the
length of curves with values on surfaces.


::: {.Proposition  #proposition-fff-length}

Let $\SSS$ be a regular surface with chart $\sss \colon U \to \R^3$. Suppose
$$
\g \colon (a,b) \to \sss(U) \subseteq \SSS 
$$
is a smooth curve. Then
$$
\g(t) = \sss (u(t), v(t)) \,, 
$$
for some smooth functions $u,v \colon (a,b) \to \R$, and 
$$
\int_{a}^{b} \norm{\dg(t)} \, dt =
\int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{  E \dot{u}^2 + 2F \dot u \dot v + G \dot{v}^2  } \, dt \,,
$$
where in the above formula:

- $\dot u, \dot v$ are computed at $t$,
- $E,F,G$ are computed at $(u(t),v(t))$.

:::


::: Proof 

Since $\g$ takes values into $\sss(U)$, by Lemma \ref{lemma-curve-S} there exist smooth functions $u,v$ such that 
$$
\g(t) = \sss (u(t), v(t)) \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
By chain rule we have
$$
\dg(t) = \dot u (t) \sss_u( u(t),v(t) ) + \dot v (t) \sss_v( u(t),v(t) ) \,.
$$
The above means that the coefficients of $\dg$ with respect to the basis $\{\sss_u,\sss_v\}$ of $T_{\pp} \SSS$ are $\dot u$ and $\dot v$, respectively. Then
$$
du(\dg) = \dot u \,, \quad dv(\dg) = \dot v \,.
$$
Since $\dg$ is a tangent vector, by Proposition \ref{proposition-fff-quadratic} we get
\begin{align*}
\norm{\dg(t)}^2 & = \dg \cdot \dg \\
                & = I_{\pp} (\dg , \dg ) \\
                & = E \, du(\dg)^2  + 2F \, du(\dg) dv(\g) + G \, dv(\dg)^2 \\ 
                & = E \, \dot{u}^2  + 2F \, \dot{u} \dot{v} + G \, \dot{v}^2 
                \,.
\end{align*}
Integrating, we obtain the desired formula
$$
\int_{a}^{b} \norm{\dg(t)} \, dt =
\int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{  E \dot{u}^2 + 2F \dot u \dot v + G \dot{v}^2  } \, dt \,,
$$
concluding the proof.

::: Example
### FFF of the Cone {#example-fff-cone}

Consider the cone with chart
$$
\sss (u,v)=(\cos(u) v, \sin (u) v, v) \,, 
$$
where $u  \in (0,2\pi)$ and $v >0$. Prove the following:

1. The first fundamental form of $\sss$ is
$$
\mathscr{F}_1 = 2 \, du^2 + u^2 \, dv^2 \,.
$$

2. Let $\g (t):= \sss(t,t)$. The length of $\g$ is
$$
\int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} \norm{\dg(t)} \, dt = \int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} \sqrt{ t^2 + 2  } \, dt  \,.
$$

*Solution*. We have
$$
\sss_u = (- \sin(u)v, \cos(u)v,0) \,, \quad 
\sss_v = (\cos(u), \sin (u), 1) \,.
$$
Therefore
\begin{align*}
E & = \sss_u \cdot \sss_u = \cos^2(u)v^2 + \sin^2 (u)v^2  = v^2 \\
F & = \sss_u \cdot \sss_v  = 0 \\
G & = \sss_v \cdot \sss_v =  \cos^2(u) + \sin^2(u) + 1  = 2
\end{align*}
The first fundamental form of $\sss$ is 
$$
\mathscr{F}_1 = v^2 \, du^2 + 2 \, dv^2 \,.
$$
Concering the curve $\g$, by definition we have
$$
\g(t) := \sss(t,t) \,,
$$
so that 
$$
u(t) = t \,, \quad v(t) = t \,.
$$
In particular
$$
\dot u = 1\,, \quad \dot v = 1
$$ 
and 
\begin{align*}
E(u(t),v(t)) & = E(t,t) = t^2 \\
F(u(t),v(t)) & = F(t,t) = 0 \\
G(u(t),v(t)) & = G(t,t) = 2  \,.
\end{align*}
By Proposition \ref{proposition-fff-length} we have
\begin{align*}
\int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} \norm{\dg(t)} \, dt & = 
\int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} \sqrt{  E \dot{u}^2 + 2F \dot u \dot v + G \dot{v}^2  } \, dt \\
& = \int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} \sqrt{  t^2 + 2   } \, dt   \,.
\end{align*}

### Isometries

Isometries are an important class of maps between surfaces: They are smooth maps which preserve the first fundamental form.


::: Definition 
### Local Isometry and Isometry

Let $\SSS$ and $\wSSS$ be regular surfaces and 
$$
f \colon \SSS \to \wSSS
$$
be a smooth map. Denote the differential of $f$ by
$$
d_{\pp}f \colon T_{\pp} \SSS \to T_{f(\pp)} \wSSS \,.
$$

We say that:


1. $f$ is a **local isometry**, if for all $\pp \in \SSS$
$$
\vv \cdot \ww  = d_{\pp}f (\vv) \cdot d_{\pp}f (\ww) \,, \quad 
\forall \, \vv, \ww \in T_{\pp} \SSS \,. 
$${#eq-loc-iso}
In this case, $\SSS$ and $\wSSS$ are said to be **locally isometric**.

2. $f$ is an **isometry** if:
    * $f$ is a local isometry;
    * $f$ is a diffeomorphism of $\SSS$ into $\wSSS$.  
    
   In this case, $\SSS$ and $\wSSS$ are said to be **isometric**.
    

:::


Recall that the first fundamental form of $\SSS$ is defined by
$$
I_{\pp} (\vv, \ww) = \vv \cdot  \ww \,, \quad \vv, \ww \in T_{\pp} \SSS \,.
$$
Therefore, condition (@eq-loc-iso) reads
$$
I_{\pp} (\vv,\ww) = I_{\pp} (d_{\pp}f(\vv), d_{\pp}f(\ww)) \,, \quad 
\forall \, \vv, \ww \in T_{\pp} \SSS \,. 
$$
In this sense, we see that local isometries preserve the first fundamental form.


![Sketch of a local isometry $f$ between $\SSS$ and $\widetilde{\SSS}$. The scalar product between tangent vectors $\vv$ and $\ww$ is preserved by $d_{\pp}f$.](/images/fff_local_isometry.png){width=70%}




::: {.Remark #remark-local-isometry}

A smooth map $f \colon \SSS \to \widetilde{\SSS}$ is a local isometry if and only 
if 
$$
\vv \cdot \vv = d_{\pp} f (\vv) \cdot d_{\pp} f (\vv) \,, \quad 
\forall \, \vv \in T_{\pp} \SSS \,. 
$$

*Proof.* The thesis follows immediately from the elementary identity
$$
\vv \cdot \ww = \frac12 \left(   (\vv + \ww ) \cdot (\vv + \ww ) - \vv \cdot \vv - \ww \cdot \ww       \right) \,, 
$$
which holds for all $\vv, \ww \in T_{\pp} \SSS$ (and more in general in arbitrary vector spaces with inner product).

:::



Local isometries are automatically local diffeomorphisms.


::: {.Proposition #prop-isometry-diffeo}

Let $\SSS$ and $\wSSS$ be regular surfaces and 
$$
f \colon \SSS \to \wSSS
$$
a local isometry. Then $f$ is a local diffeomorphims.

:::

::: Proof

Let $\pp \in \SSS$. Assume by contradiction that the differential of $f$
$$
d_{\pp}f \colon T_{\pp} \SSS \to T_{f(\pp)} \wSSS \,,
$$
is not invertible. As $d_{\pp}f$ is linear, this implies $d_{\pp}f$ is not injective. Therefore
$$
\operatorname{ker} \left(d_{\pp}f \right) \neq \{ \zero \} \,,
$$
meaning that there exists $\vv \in T_{\pp} \SSS$ such that
$$
d_{\pp}f(\vv) = \zero \,, \qquad \vv \neq \zero \,.
$$
Using that $f$ is a local isometry, we get
$$
\| \vv \|^2 = \vv \cdot \vv = d_{\pp}f(\vv) \cdot d_{\pp}f (\vv) = 0  \,,
$$
which implies $\vv = \zero$. This is a contradiction, and therefore $d_{\pp}f$ has to be invertible. By Theorem \ref{theorem-df-invertible}, we conclude that $f$ is a local diffeomorphism at $\pp$. As $\pp \in \SSS$ is arbitrary, we infer that $f$ is a local diffeomorphism of $\SSS$ into $\wSSS$.

:::




::: Remark

We have just seen that local isometries are also local diffeomorphisms. By definition, isometries are local isometries which are also diffeomorphisms. As such:

1. Isometries are local isometries,
2. Local isometries are not isometries

This is because, in general, local diffeomorphisms are not global diffeomorphisms, see Example \ref{example-plane-cylinder-2}.

:::



Local isometries preserve the length of curves, as shown in the following Proposition.


::: Proposition

Let $\SSS$ and $\wSSS$ be regular surfaces and $f \colon \SSS \to \wSSS$ be a smooth map. They are equivalent:

1. $f$ is a local isometry.
2. Let $\g$ be a curve in $\SSS$ and consider the curve $\tg = f \circ \g$ on $\wSSS$. Then $\g$ and $\tg$ have the same length.

:::


::: Proof

*Part 1.* Suppose $\g \colon (a,b) \to \SSS$ is a smooth curve. 
Consider the smooth curve 
$$
\tg \colon (a,b) \to \widetilde{\SSS} \,, \qquad \tg := f \circ \g\,.
$$
Set $\pp :=\g(t)$, so that
$$
\dg(t) \in T_{\pp} \SSS \,.
$$
By definition of differential of a function between surfaces, we have
$$
d_{\pp}f (\dg(t))  = \dtg(t)\,.
$$
Using that $f$ is a local isometry gives:
\begin{align*}
\norm{\dtg(t)}^2 & = \dtg(t) \cdot \dtg(t) \\
               & = d_{\pp}f (\dg(t)) \cdot d_{\pp}f (\dg(t)) \\
               & = \dg(t) \cdot \dg(t) \\
               & = \norm{\dg(t)}^2
\end{align*}
Therefore $\g$ and $\tg$ have the same length:
$$
\int_{a}^{b} \norm{\dtg(t)}\, dt 
= \int_{a}^{b} \norm{\dg(t)}\, dt \,.
$$

*Part 2.* 
We need to prove that $f$ is a local isometry. By Remark \ref{remark-local-isometry}, it is sufficient to show that
$$
d_{\pp}f (\vv) \cdot d_{\pp}f (\vv) = \vv \cdot \vv \,, \quad \forall \, \vv \in T_{\pp}(\SSS) \,.  
$${#eq-proof-loc-iso}
Therefore, let $\vv \in T_{\pp} \SSS$ be arbitrary. By definition of tangent plane, there exists a curve $\g \colon (-\e,\e) \to \SSS$ such that
$$
\g(0) = \pp \,, \quad \dg(0) = \vv \,.
$$
Define the curve 
$$
\tg \colon (-\e,\e) \to \widetilde{\SSS}  \,, \qquad \tg := f \circ \g  \,.
$$
By assumption, $\g$ and $\tg$ have the same length, that is,
$$
\int_{-\e}^{\e} \sqrt{ \dtg(t) \cdot \dtg(t) }\, dt 
= \int_{-\e}^{\e} \sqrt{ \dg(t) \cdot \dg(t) }\, dt \,.
$$
Since the above equality is true for each $\e>0$, and the functions being integrated are continuous, we infer
$$
\dtg(0) \cdot \dtg(0) = \dg(0) \cdot \dg(0) \,.
$$
Recall that by definition of differential we have
$$
d_{\pp}f (\vv) = \dtg(0) \,.
$$
Therefore 
\begin{align*}
d_{\pp}f (\vv) \cdot d_{\pp}f (\vv) & = \dtg(0) \cdot \dtg(0) \\
                                    & = \dg(0) \cdot \dg(0) \\
                                    & = \vv \cdot \vv \,.
\end{align*}

By definition, local isometries preserve the first fundamental form. The next Theorem gives a practical method to check if a map is a local isometry.


::: {.Theorem  #theorem-local-isometry}

Let $\SSS$ and $\widetilde{\SSS}$ be regular surfaces and $f \colon \SSS \to \widetilde{\SSS}$ be a local diffeomorphism. They are equivalent:

1. $f$ is a local isometry.
2. Let $\sss \colon U \to \SSS$ be a regular chart of $\SSS$ and consider the chart of $\widetilde{\SSS}$ given by  
$$
\widetilde{\sss} \colon U \to \widetilde{\SSS} \,, \qquad 
\widetilde{\sss} = f \circ \sss \,.
$$
Then $\sss$ and $\widetilde{\sss}$ have the same first fundamental form, that is, 
$$
E = \widetilde{E} \,, \quad F = \widetilde{F} \,, \quad G = \widetilde{G} \,,
$$
where 
\begin{align*}
E & = \sss_u \cdot \sss_u \,, \quad
F = \sss_u \cdot \sss_v \,, \quad
G = \sss_v \cdot \sss_v \,, \\
\widetilde{E} & = \widetilde{\sss}_u \cdot \widetilde{\sss}_u \,, \quad
\widetilde{F}  = \widetilde{\sss}_u \cdot \widetilde{\sss}_v \,, \quad
\widetilde{G}  = \widetilde{\sss}_v \cdot \widetilde{\sss}_v \,.
\end{align*}


**Note:** $E,F,G$ and $\widetilde{E},\widetilde{F},\widetilde{G}$ are defined on the same set $U$. Therefore, equality is intended pointwise.

::: Proof

*Part 1.* Suppose that $f$ is a local isometry, that is,
$$
{\vv} \cdot {\ww} = d_{\pp} f ({\vv}) \cdot d_{\pp} f ({\ww}) \,, \quad \forall \, {\vv} , {\ww} \in T_{\pp} \SSS \,.
$$
Let $\sss$ be a chart for $\SSS$ at $\pp$. Define 
$$
\widetilde{\sss} = f \circ \sss \,.
$$
Since $f$ is a local isometry, then it is also a local diffeomorhims by Proposition \ref{prop-isometry-diffeo}. In particular, Proposition \ref{proposition-f-chart} ensures that $\widetilde{\sss}$ is a regualar chart of $\widetilde{\SSS}$ at $f(\pp)$. Now, recall the statement of Proposition \ref{proposition-differential-smooth}: if
$$
\widetilde{\sss} ( \alpha(u,v), \beta(u,v) ) = f ( \sss (u,v) ) \,,
$$
for some smooth maps 
$$
\alpha,\beta \colon U \to \widetilde{U} \,,
$$
then the matrix of $d_{\pp} f$ with respect to the basis 
$$
\{ \sss_u , \sss_v \} \,\,\, \mbox{ of } \,\,\, T_{\pp} \SSS \,, \quad  
\{ \widetilde{\sss}_u , \widetilde{\sss}_v \} \,\,\, \mbox{ of } \,\,\, T_{f(\pp)} \widetilde{\SSS} \,,
$$
is given by
$$
d_{\pp} f = 
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
\alpha_u & \alpha_v \\
\beta_u  & \beta_v
\end{array}
\right) \,.
$$
In our case, we have $U = \widetilde{U}$ and
$$
\widetilde{\sss} (u, v ) = f ( \sss (u,v) )\,,
$$
so that 
$$
\alpha(u,v) = u \,, \quad 
\beta(u,v) = v \,.
$$
Therefore 
$$
d_{\pp} f = 
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
\alpha_u & \alpha_v \\
\beta_u  & \beta_v
\end{array}
\right) 
=
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0 \\
0  & 1
\end{array}
\right) \,,
$$
which means that 
\begin{align*}
d_{\pp} f(\sss_u)  & = 1 \cdot \widetilde{\sss}_u + 0 \cdot \widetilde{\sss}_v = \widetilde{\sss}_u \\
d_{\pp} f(\sss_v)  & = 0 \cdot \widetilde{\sss}_u + 1 \cdot \widetilde{\sss}_v = \widetilde{\sss}_v \\
\end{align*}
Using that $f$ is a local isometry gives
\begin{align*}
E & = \sss_u \cdot \sss_u 
    = d_{\pp} f (\sss_u) \cdot d_{\pp} f (\sss_u) \\
  & = \widetilde{\sss}_u \cdot \widetilde{\sss}_u 
    = \widetilde{E} \,.
\end{align*}
Simlarly, we obtain also
\begin{align*}
F & = \sss_u \cdot \sss_v 
    = d_{\pp} f (\sss_u) \cdot d_{\pp} f (\sss_v) \\
  & = \widetilde{\sss}_u \cdot \widetilde{\sss}_v 
    = \widetilde{F} \,,
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align*}
G & = \sss_v \cdot \sss_v 
    = d_{\pp} f (\sss_v) \cdot d_{\pp} f (\sss_v) \\
  & = \widetilde{\sss}_v \cdot \widetilde{\sss}_v 
    = \widetilde{G} \,,
\end{align*}
showing that $\sss$ and $\widetilde{\sss}$ have the same first fundamental form.



*Part 2.* Define $\widetilde{\sss} = f \circ \sss$ and suppose that $\sss$ and $\widetilde{\sss}$ have the same first fundamental form. In particular they hold
\begin{align*}
\sss_u \cdot \sss_u & = \widetilde{\sss}_u \cdot \widetilde{\sss}_u \\
\sss_u \cdot \sss_v & = \widetilde{\sss}_u \cdot \widetilde{\sss}_v \\
\sss_v \cdot \sss_v & = \widetilde{\sss}_v \cdot \widetilde{\sss}_v 
\end{align*}
As discussed above, since $\widetilde{\sss} = f \circ \sss$, by Proposition \ref{proposition-differential-smooth} we get
$$
d_{\pp} f(\sss_u)  = \widetilde{\sss}_u \,, \quad 
d_{\pp} f(\sss_v)  = \widetilde{\sss}_v \,.
$$
Let $\vv \in T_{\pp} \SSS$. Since $\{\sss_u,\sss_v\}$ is a basis for $T_{\pp} \SSS$, we get
$$
\vv = \lambda \sss_u + \mu \sss_v 
$$
for some $\lambda,\mu \in \R$. Therefore
\begin{align*}
d_{\pp} f (\vv) & = d_{\pp} f(\lambda \sss_u + \mu \sss_v ) \\
                & = \lambda \, d_{\pp} f (\sss_u) + \mu \, d_{\pp} f (\sss_v)\\
                & = \lambda \widetilde{\sss}_u + \mu \widetilde{\sss}_v \,.
\end{align*}
Hence
\begin{align*}
\vv \cdot \vv & = ( \lambda \sss_u + \mu \sss_v ) \cdot  (\lambda \sss_u + \mu \sss_v) \\
              & = \lambda^2 (\sss_u \cdot \sss_u) + 2 \lambda\mu (\sss_u \cdot \sss_v) + \mu^2 (\sss_v \cdot \sss_v) \\ 
              & = \lambda^2 ( \widetilde{\sss}_u \cdot \widetilde{\sss}_u) +
              2\lambda \mu ( \widetilde{\sss}_u \cdot \widetilde{\sss}_v) + 
              \mu^2 ( \widetilde{\sss}_v \cdot \widetilde{\sss}_v) \\
              & = (\lambda \widetilde{\sss}_u + \mu \widetilde{\sss}_v) 
              \cdot (\lambda \widetilde{\sss}_u + \mu \widetilde{\sss}_v) \\
              & = d_{\pp} f (\vv) \cdot 
                  d_{\pp} f (\vv) \,, 
\end{align*}
showing that 
$$
\vv \cdot \vv = d_{\pp} f (\vv) \cdot d_{\pp} f (\vv)  \,, \quad \forall \, \vv \in T_{\pp} \SSS \,.
$$
By Remark \ref{remark-local-isometry} we conclude that $f$ is a local isometry.

:::



::: {.Remark #remark-local-isometry-chart}

To prove that a smooth map
$$
f \colon \SSS \to \widetilde{\SSS}
$$
is a local isometry, it is sufficient to verify Condition 2 in Theorem \ref{theorem-local-isometry} on one atlas of $\SSS$. Then, automatically, all other atlases will verify the condition, ensuring that $f$ is a local isometry.

To see this, suppose we can verify Condition 2 on the chart $\sss \colon U \to \SSS$, that is, suppose we have proven
$$
\widetilde{\mathscr{F}}_1 = \mathscr{F}_1 \,,
$${#eq-local-isometry-chart-1}
where $\widetilde{\mathscr{F}}_1$ is the first fundamental form of $\widetilde{\sss} = f \circ \sss$. Assume that $\hat{\sss} \colon \hat{U} \to \SSS$ is another chart of $\SSS$. By Remark \ref{remark-fff-reparametrization}, the fundamental forms of $\hat{\sss}$ and $\sss$ are related by
$$
\hat{\mathscr{F}}_1 = (J\Phi)^T \mathscr{F}_1 J\Phi
$${#eq-local-isometry-chart-2}
where $\Phi$ is the transition map $\Phi \colon \hat{U} \to U$ such that 
$$
\hat{\sss} = \sss \circ \Phi \,.
$$
Applying $f$ to $\hat{\sss}$ gives
$$
\sss^{\dagger} := f \circ \hat{\sss} = f \circ \sss \circ \Phi = \widetilde{\sss} \circ \Phi \,,
$$
showing that $\sss^{\dagger}$ is a reparametrization of $\widetilde{\sss}$ with transition map $\Phi$. Therefore, by Remark \ref{remark-fff-reparametrization}, the fundamental forms of $\sss^{\dagger}$ and $\widetilde{\sss}$ are related by
$$
\mathscr{F}^\dagger_1 = (J\Phi)^T \widetilde{\mathscr{F}}_1 J\Phi
$$
Recalling (@eq-local-isometry-chart-1) and (@eq-local-isometry-chart-2), we get
\begin{align*}
\mathscr{F}^\dagger_1 & = (J\Phi)^T \widetilde{\mathscr{F}}_1 J\Phi  \\
& =  (J\Phi)^T \mathscr{F}_1 J\Phi  \\
& = \hat{\mathscr{F}}_1 \,.
\end{align*}
We have therefore proven that $\hat{\sss}$ and $\sss^\dagger = f \circ \hat{\sss}$ have the same first fundamental form. Thus $\hat{\sss}$ satisfies Condition 2 in Theorem \ref{theorem-local-isometry}.

Sometimes, we wish to determine if two surfaces $\SSS$ and 
$\wSSS$ are locally isometric, but it is not clear how to construct a map 
$$
f \colon \SSS \to \wSSS \,.
$$
As an alternative, we can shift the problem of finding $f$, to the problem of finding suitable charts $\sss$ of $\SSS$, and $\wsss$ of $\wSSS$, such that $\sss$ and $\wsss$ have the same first fundamntal form. This is detailed in the next Theorem.



::: {.Theorem  #theorem-local-isometry-2}

Let $\SSS$ and $\widetilde{\SSS}$ be regular surfaces and consider charts
$$
\sss \colon U \to \SSS \,, \qquad 
\wsss \colon U \to \wSSS \,.
$$
Assume that $\sss$ and $\wsss$ have the same first fundamental form: 
$$
E = \widetilde{E} \,, \quad F = \widetilde{F} \,, \quad G = \widetilde{G} \,.
$$
We have:

1. The surfaces $\sss(U)$ and $\wSSS$ are locally isometric.
2. A local isometry is given by
$$
f \colon \sss(U) \to \wSSS \,, \qquad 
f = \wsss \circ \sss^{-1} \,.
$$


**Note:** $\sss$ and $\wsss$ are defined on the same open set $U$. Therefore, $E,F,G$ and $\widetilde{E},\widetilde{F},\widetilde{G}$ are defined on $U$, and the equality is intended pointwise.

:::


::: Proof

Define $f = \wsss \circ \sss^{-1}$, and notice that
$$
f \circ \sss = \wsss \circ \sss^{-1} \circ \sss = \wsss \,.
$$
Therefore, by assumption, $\sss$ and $\wsss$ have the same first fundamental form. Note that the chart $\sss$ gives an atlas for the surface $\sss(U)$. Hence, by Theorem \ref{theorem-local-isometry-2}, we conclude that $f$ is a local isometry between $\sss(U)$ and $\wSSS$.

::: Example
### Plane and Cylinder are locally isometric {#example-plane-cylinder}

Consider the plane
$$
\SSS = \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3   \, \colon \, x = 0  \} \,,
$$
and the unit cylinder 
$$
\SSS = \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \, \colon \,  x^2 + y^2 = 1 \} \,.
$$
Define the function
$$
f \colon \SSS \to \wSSS \,, \qquad f(0,y,z) = (\cos(y),\sin(y),z) \,.
$$

1. Prove that $f$ is smooth.
2. Prove that $f$ is a local isometry.

**Note:** This shows that the Plane and the Cylinder are locally isometric.

*Solution.*

1. Note that $f \in \wSSS$ because
$$
\cos(y)^2 + \sin(y)^2 = 1\,,
$$
therefore $f$ is well-defined. Moreover, $f$ is the restriction to $\SSS$ of the function
$$
g \colon \R^3 \to \R^3 \,, \qquad g(x,y,z) = (\cos(y),\sin(y),z) \,.
$$
Since $g$ is smooth, and $g(\SSS) = \wSSS$, 
by Proposition \ref{proposition-diff-check} we infer that $g |_{\SSS} = f$ is smooth between $\SSS$ and $\wSSS$.

2. Define the chart of $\SSS$:
$$
\sss(u,v) = (0,u,v) \,, \quad u,v \in \R \,.
$$
We already know that $\sss$ is regular, with first fundamental form coefficients given by
$$
E = 1 \,, \quad F = 1 \,, \quad G = 1 \,,
$$
and corresponding first fundamental form
$$
{\FF}_1 = du^2 + dv^2 \,.
$$
Define $\wsss = f \circ \sss$. Therefore,
$$
\wsss(u,v) = f(0,u,v) = (\cos(u),\sin(u),v) \,.
$$
We have that
\begin{align*}
\wsssu & = ( -\sin(u),\cos(u),0 ) \\
\wsssv & = (0,0,1) \\
\wE & = \wsssu \cdot \wsssu = 1 \\  
\wF & = \wsssu \cdot \wsssv = 0 \\
\wG & = \wsssv \cdot \wsssv = 1 
\end{align*}
Therefore, the first fundamental form of $\wsss = f \circ \sss$ is
$$
{\wFF}_1 =  du^2 + dv^2 \,.
$$
In particular, we have shown that $\sss$ and $\wsss$ have the same first fundamental form:
$$
{\FF}_1 = {\wFF}_1 \,.
$$
Since $\mathcal{A} = \{\sss\}$ is an atlas for $\SSS$, by Theorem \ref{theorem-local-isometry-2} we conclude that $f$ is a local isometry of $\SSS$ into $\wSSS$.

:::



::: Example
### Plane and Cylinder are not isometric {#example-plane-cylinder-2}

Consider again the plane
$$
\SSS = \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3   \, \colon \, x = 0  \} \,,
$$
and the unit cylinder 
$$
\wSSS = \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \, \colon \,  x^2 + y^2 = 1 \} \,.
$$
We have seen in Example \ref{example-plane-cylinder} that $\SSS$ and $\wSSS$ are locally isometric. However, $\SSS$ and $\wSSS$ are **not isometric**.

*Proof.* The surfaces $\SSS$ and $\wSSS$ are nor homeomorphic, and therefore they cannot be isometric (and hence diffeomorphic). We cannot rigorously prove this claim with our current knowledge of topology. However, to give some intuition, here is a sketch of the argument, see @fig-simply-connected:

- Any simple closed curve $\g$ in the plane $\SSS$ can be shrunk continuously into a point without leaving $\SSS$. In this case we say that $\SSS$ is **simply connected**.
- If $\SSS$ and $\wSSS$ were to be homeomorphic, then $\wSSS$ would be simply connected.
- However, a parallel $\g$ of the Cylinder $\wSSS$ cannot be shrunk continuously into a point without leaving the Cylinder. Thus, $\wSSS$ is not simply connected.
- Hence, the Plane and the Cylinder cannot be homeomorphic.

::: Example
### Plane and Cone are locally isometric

Consider the cone without tip
$$
\SSS = \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \, \colon \, x^2 + y^2 = z^2 \,, \,\, z > 0 \} \,,
$$
and the plane
$$
\SSS = \{ (x,y,z)\in \R^3 \, \colon \, z = 0 \} \,.
$$
It is possible to directly construct a local isometry between $\SSS$ and $\wSSS$, see Example 3 at page 226 of [@do-carmo]. However, we proceed in an alternative way.

1. Let $\sss \colon U \to \SSS$ be the chart of the Cone
$$
\sss(\rho,\theta) = (\rho \cos(\theta), \rho \sin(\theta), \rho ) \,,
$$
where we define
$$
U:= \left\{ (\rho,\theta) \in \R^2 \, \colon \, \rho > 0 , \, \theta \in (0,2\pi) \right\} \,. 
$$ 
Compute the first fundamental form ${\FF}_1$ of $\sss$.

2. Let $\wsss \colon U \to \wSSS$ be the chart of the Plane
$$
\wsss(\rho,\theta) = (a\rho \cos(b\theta), a\rho \sin(b\theta), 0 )
$$
where $a>0$ and $b \in (0,1]$ are constants. Compute the first fundamental form ${\wFF}_1$ of $\wsss$.


3. Find coefficients $a,b$ such that 
$$
{\FF}_1 = {\wFF}_1 \,.
$$

4. Conclude that $\SSS$ and $\wSSS$ are locally isometric.


*Solution*.

1. We have already computed in Example \ref{example-fff-cone}, that the first fundamental form of $\sss$ is
$$
{\FF}_1 = 2 d\rho^2 + \rho^2 d\theta^2 \,.
$$


2. First of all, note that 
$$
\theta \in (0,2\pi), \quad b \in (0,1] \quad \implies \quad 
b \theta \in (0,2\pi) \,,
$$
showing that $\wsss$ is well defined for all $(\rho,\theta) \in U$. We compute
\begin{align*}
{\wsss}_{\rho} & = ( a \cos(b\theta), a \sin(b\theta), 0 ) \\
{\wsss}_{\theta} & = ( - ab \rho \sin(b \theta), ab\rho \cos(b\theta), 0 ) \\
\wE & = {\wsss}_{\rho} \cdot {\wsss}_{\rho} = a^2 \\  
\wF & = {\wsss}_{\rho} \cdot {\wsss}_{\theta} = 0 \\
\wG & = {\wsss}_{\theta} \cdot {\wsss}_{\theta} = a^2b^2 \rho^2
\end{align*}
from which we conclude that the first fundamental form of $\wsss$ is
$$
{\wFF}_1 = a^2 d\rho^2 + a^2b^2 \rho^2 d\rho^2 \,.
$$


3. Equating ${\FF}_1$ and ${\wFF}_1$ we obtain
$$
a^2 = 2 , \,\, a^2b^2 = 1 \quad \implies \quad a = \sqrt{2} \,, \,\, b = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \,.
$$
Note that $a>0$ and $0<b<1$, showing that $a,b$ are admissible.


4. For $a = \sqrt{2}$ and $b = 1/\sqrt{2}$ we have that 
$$
{\FF}_1 = {\wFF}_1 \,.
$$
Since $\sss$ and $\wsss$ are regular charts for $\SSS$ and $\wSSS$, respectively, from Theorem \ref{theorem-local-isometry} we conclude that $\SSS$ and $\wSSS$ are locally isometric. Furthermore, the local isometry is given by
$$
f \colon \SSS \to \wSSS \,, \qquad f = \wsss \circ \sss^{-1} \,.
$$

Similarly, we obtain

\| \ww \|^2 & = \ww \cdot \ww = E  \tilde{\lambda}^2 + 2 F  \tilde{\lambda} \tilde{\mu}  + G  \tilde{\mu}^2 \,.

Substituting in (@eq-angle-proof) we conclude.

### Conformal maps


Local isometries are maps which preserve the **scalar product** between tangent vectors. We want to consider maps which preserve the **angle** between tangent
vectors. These will be called **conformal maps**.


::: Definition
### Conformal map

Let $\SSS$ and $\widetilde{\SSS}$ be regular surfaces, and 
$$
f \colon \SSS \to \wSSS
$$
a local diffeomorphism. We say that $f$ is a **conformal map** if for all $\pp \in \SSS$ and $\vv , \ww \in T_{\pp} \SSS$ is holds
$$
\theta = \widetilde{\theta} \,,
$$
where:

- $\theta$ is the angle between $\vv$ and $\ww$,
- $\widetilde{\theta}$ is the angle between $d_{\pp} f(\vv)$ and $d_{\pp} f(\ww)$.

In this case, we say that $\SSS$ and $\wSSS$ are **conformal**.

::: Notation

For brevity we denote 
$$
\scp{\vv}{\ww} := \vv \cdot \ww  \,, \quad 
\scp{\vv}{\ww}_f := d_{\pp}f (\vv) \cdot d_{\pp}f (\ww) \,,
$$
and also
$$
\| \vv \| := \sqrt{ \scp{v}{v} } \,, \quad  
\| \vv \|_f := \sqrt{ \scp{v}{v}_f } \,.
$$

:::



::: Remark

We have that $f$ is a conformal map if and only if
$$
\frac{ \scp{\vv}{\ww} }{ \| \vv \| \, \| \ww \| } = 
\frac{ \scp{\vv}{\ww}_f  }{ \| \vv \|_f \, \| \ww \|_f } \,, \quad \forall \, \vv , \ww \in T_{\pp} \SSS \,.
$$


*Proof.* Follows immediately by the definition of angle between vectors.

:::




::: Proposition

Let $f$ be a local isometry. Then $f$ is a conformal map.

:::


::: Proof


By definition of local isometry we have
$$
\scp{\vv}{\ww} =  \scp{\vv}{\ww}_f  \,, \quad \forall \, \vv , \ww \in T_{\pp} \SSS \,.
$$
In particular we have
$$
\| \vv \|^2  = \scp{\vv}{\vv} 
             = \scp{\vv}{\vv}_f 
             = \| \vv \|^2_f \,,
$$
for all $\vv \in T_{\pp} \SSS$. Therefore 
$$
\frac{ \scp{\vv}{\ww} }{ \| \vv \| \, \| \ww \| } = 
\frac{ \scp{\vv}{\ww}_f }{ \| \vv \|_f \, \| \ww \|_f } \,,
$$
showing that $f$ is a conformal map.


:::


Therefore, every local isometry is a conformal map. The converse is false,
as we will show in Example \ref{example-conformal} below. 
Before giving the example, let us provide a characterization of conformal
maps in terms of the first fundamental form.


::: {.Theorem #theorem-conformal}

Let $\SSS$ and $\widetilde{\SSS}$ be regular surfaces and $f \colon \SSS \to \widetilde{\SSS}$ a local diffeomorphism. They are equivalent:

1. $f$ is a conformal map.
2. There exists a function $\lambda \colon \SSS \to \R$ such that 
$$
\scp{\vv}{\ww}_f =  \lambda (\pp) \, \scp{\vv}{\ww} \,, \quad \forall \, \vv,\ww \in T_{\pp} \SSS \,.
$$

:::




::: Proof

*Step 1.* Suppose $f$ is a conformal map, so that 
$$
\frac{ \scp{\vv}{\ww} }{ \| \vv \| \, \| \ww \| } = 
\frac{ \scp{\vv}{\ww}_f }{ \| \vv \|_f \, \| \ww \|_f } \,, \quad \forall \, \vv , \ww \in T_{\pp} \SSS \,.
$${#eq-theorem-conformal-proof}
Let $\{\pmb{\alpha}_1,\pmb{\alpha}_2\}$ be an orthonormal basis for $T_{\pp} \SSS$, that is, 
$$
\scp{\pmb{\alpha}_1}{\pmb{\alpha}_2} = 0 \,, \quad
\| \pmb{\alpha}_1  \| = \| \pmb{\alpha}_2 \| = 1 \,.
$$
Define 
\begin{align*}
\lambda(\pp) & := \scp{\pmb{\alpha_1}}{\pmb{\alpha_1}}_f = \| \pmb{\alpha_1} \|_f^2 \,, \\
\mu(\pp) & := \scp{\pmb{\alpha_1}}{\pmb{\alpha_2}}_f \,, \\
\nu(\pp) & := \scp{\pmb{\alpha_2}}{\pmb{\alpha_2}}_f = \| \pmb{\alpha_2} \|_f^2   \,.
\end{align*}
By (@eq-theorem-conformal-proof) we have
$$
\frac{\scp{\pmb{\alpha_1}}{\pmb{\alpha_2}}}{ \| \pmb{\alpha_1} \| \| \pmb{\alpha_2} \|  } = 
\frac{\scp{\pmb{\alpha_1}}{\pmb{\alpha_2}}_f}{ \| \pmb{\alpha_1} \|_f \| \pmb{\alpha_2} \|_f  } \,.
$$
Since $\pmb{\alpha}_1 \cdot \pmb{\alpha}_2 = 0$, from the above we get
$$
\mu (\pp) = \scp{\pmb{\alpha}_1}{\pmb{\alpha}_2 }_f = 0 \,.
$$
Moreover, since $\pmb{\alpha}_1$ and $\pmb{\alpha}_2$ are orthonormal, 
the angle between $\pmb{\alpha}_1$ and $\pmb{\alpha}_1 + \pmb{\alpha}_2$ is
$\theta = \pi/4$. By definition of angle between vectors, we infer
$$
\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \cos (\theta) = \frac{ \scp{\pmb{\alpha}_1}{\pmb{\alpha}_1 + \pmb{\alpha}_2}  }{ \| \pmb{\alpha}_1 \| \| \pmb{\alpha}_1 + \pmb{\alpha}_1 \| } \,. 
$$
On the other hand, using (@eq-theorem-conformal-proof) we get
$$
\frac{ \scp{\pmb{\alpha}_1}{\pmb{\alpha}_1 + \pmb{\alpha}_2}  }{ \| \pmb{\alpha}_1 \| \| \pmb{\alpha}_1 + \pmb{\alpha}_1 \| } =
\frac{ \scp{\pmb{\alpha}_1}{\pmb{\alpha}_1 + \pmb{\alpha}_2}_f  }{ \| \pmb{\alpha}_1 \|_f \| \pmb{\alpha}_1 + \pmb{\alpha}_2 \|_f } \,. 
$$
The numerator of the right hand side satisfies
\begin{align*}
 \scp{\pmb{\alpha}_1}{\pmb{\alpha}_1 + \pmb{\alpha}_2}_f & 
 =  \scp{\pmb{\alpha}_1}{\pmb{\alpha}_1 }_f +  \scp{\pmb{\alpha}_1}{\pmb{\alpha}_2}_f  \\
 & = \lambda(\pp) + \mu (\pp) \\
 & = \lambda(\pp) \,,
\end{align*}
since $\mu (\pp) = 0$. Concerning the denominator, we have
\begin{align*}
\| \pmb{\alpha}_1 + \pmb{\alpha}_2 \|_f^2 & = 
\| \pmb{\alpha}_1  \|_f^2 + \scp{\pmb{\alpha}_1}{\pmb{\alpha}_2}_f  + 
\| \pmb{\alpha}_2 \|_f^2 \\
& = \lambda(\pp) + \mu(\pp) + \nu (\pp) \\
& = \lambda(\pp) + \nu (\pp)  \,,
\end{align*}
since $\mu (\pp) = 0$. Putting together the last 4 groups of equations, we obtain
$$
\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{ \lambda }{ \lambda^{1/2} (\lambda + \nu)^{1/2} } \,.
$$
Rearraging the above equation yields
$$
\lambda (\pp) = \nu (\pp) \,.
$$
Now let $\vv \in T_{\pp} \SSS$. Since $\{ \pmb{\alpha}_1, \pmb{\alpha}_2\}$ is a basis for $T_{\pp} \SSS$, there exist $v_1,v_2 \in \R$ such that
$$
\vv = v_1 \pmb{\alpha}_1 + v_2 \pmb{\alpha}_2 \,.
$$
Therefore 
\begin{align*}
\scp{\vv}{\vv} & = v_1^2 \scp{\pmb{\alpha}_1}{\pmb{\alpha}_1} + 
                2 v_1 v_2 \scp{\pmb{\alpha}_1}{\pmb{\alpha}_2} +
                v_2^2 \scp{\pmb{\alpha}_2}{\pmb{\alpha}_2} \\
                & = v_1^2 + v_2^2 \,, 
\end{align*}
where we used that $\pmb{\alpha}_1$ and $\pmb{\alpha}_2$ are orthonormal.
On the other hand,
\begin{align*}
\scp{\vv}{\vv}_f & = v_1^2 \scp{\pmb{\alpha}_1}{\pmb{\alpha}_1}_f + 
                2 v_1 v_2 \scp{\pmb{\alpha}_1}{\pmb{\alpha}_2}_f +
                v_2^2 \scp{\pmb{\alpha}_2}{\pmb{\alpha}_2}_f \\
               & = v_1^2 \, \lambda(\pp) + 
                2 v_1 v_2 \, \mu(\pp) +
                v_2^2 \, \nu(\pp) \\
                & =  \lambda(\pp) \, (v_1^2 + v_2^2) \,,
\end{align*}
where we used that $\lambda(\pp) = \nu(\pp)$ and $\mu (\pp) = 0$. Thus
$$
\scp{\vv}{\vv}_f = \lambda(\pp) \, (v_1^2 + v_2^2) =\lambda(\pp) \, \scp{\vv}{\vv} \,, 
$$
for all $\vv \in T_{\pp} \SSS$. Since $\scp{\cdot}{\cdot}$ and 
$\scp{\cdot}{\cdot}_f$, by arguing as in Remark \ref{remark-local-isometry} we conclude that 
$$
\scp{\vv}{\ww}_f = \lambda(\pp) \, \scp{\vv}{\ww}  
$$
for all $\vv,\ww \in T_{\pp} \SSS$.


*Step 2.* Suppose that there exists a function $\lambda \colon \SSS \to \R$ such that 
$$
\scp{\vv}{\ww}_f =  \lambda (\pp) \, \scp{\vv}{\ww} \,, \quad \forall \, \vv,\ww \in T_{\pp} \SSS \,.
$$
In particular, we have
$$
\| \vv \|_f  = \sqrt{\lambda(\pp)} \| \vv \| \,, \quad \forall \, \vv \in T_{\pp} \SSS \,.
$$
Then 
$$
\frac{\scp{\vv}{\ww}_f}{ \| \vv \|_f  \| \ww \|_f } = 
\frac{\lambda (\pp) \, \scp{\vv}{\ww}}{  \sqrt{\lambda(\pp)} \| \vv \|  \sqrt{\lambda(\pp)} \| \ww \| }  = 
\frac{\scp{\vv}{\ww}}{ \| \vv \|  \| \ww \| }  \,,
$$
showing that $f$ is a conformal map.

The following result gives a practical necessary and sufficient condition to check if a map is conformal.


::: {.Theorem #theorem-conformal-fff}

Let $\SSS$ and $\widetilde{\SSS}$ be regular surfaces and $f \colon \SSS \to \widetilde{\SSS}$ be a local diffeomorphism. They are equivalent:

1. $f$ is a conformal map.
2. Let $\sss \colon U \to \SSS$ be a regular chart of $\SSS$ and consider the chart of $\widetilde{\SSS}$ given by 
$$
\widetilde{\sss}  \colon U \to \widetilde{\SSS} \,, \qquad \widetilde{\sss} = f \circ \sss \,.
$$ 
Then, there exists $\lambda \colon U \to \R$ such that

where $\mathscr{F}_1$ and $\widetilde{\mathscr{F}}_1$ are the first fundamental forms of $\sss$ and $\widetilde{\sss}$, respectively.

Theorem \ref{theorem-conformal-fff} can be easily proven by using Theorem \ref{theorem-conformal}, and by adapting the

We omit the proof.


::: {.Remark #remark-conformal-chart}

To prove that a diffeomorphism 
$$
f \colon \SSS \to \widetilde{\SSS}

is a conformal map, it is sufficient to verify Condition 2 in Theorem \ref{theorem-conformal-fff} on one atlas of $\SSS$. Then, automatically, all other atlases will verify the condition, ensuring that $f$ is a conformal map.

::: Example
### Stereographic Projection {#example-conformal}

Denote the unit sphere by 
$$
\sphere^2 = \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \, \colon \, x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 \} \,,
$$
and consider the surface
$$
\SSS = \sphere^2 \smallsetminus \{N\} \,,
$$
where the point $N = (0,0,1)$ is the North Pole. Denote the plane $\{z = 0\}$ by
$$
\wSSS = \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \, \colon \, z = 0 \} \,,
$$ 
The plane $\{z=0\}$ slices through the equator of the sphere. Let $P=(x,y,z)$ be any point on $\sphere^2$ except the north pole. The line joining the north pole to $P$ intersects the plane $\{z=0\}$ at the point $P'$, see @fig-stereographic-4. The point $P'$ defines the *Stereographic Projection* map, which is easily computed to be:
$$
f \colon \SSS \to \wSSS \,, \quad 
f(x,y,z) = \left( \frac{x}{1-z},\frac{y}{1-z},0  \right) \,.
$$
Prove that:

1. $f$ is a conformal map.
2. $f$ is not a local isometry.

**Note**: In particular, the Sphere and the Plane are conformal.

::: {.content-hidden}
Notice that $\pi$ is slightly different from the map described in @fig-stereographic: there the projection is done onto the plane $\{z=-1\}$, while in this example we project on the plane $\{z=0\}$. This is just because calculations are more convenient when projecting on $\{z=0\}$. 

:::


*Solution.* It is not difficult to prove that $f$ is invertible, with inverse given by 
$$
\sss(u,v) =\left( \frac{2u}{u^2+v^2+1},  \frac{2v}{u^2+v^2+1} , 1-\frac{2}{u^2+v^2+1}\right) \,.
$$
We have that $\sss$ is a regular chart for $\SSS$, forming an altas of one chart. It is straightforward to compute that the coefficients of the first fundamental form of $\sss$ are
$$
E = G = \lambda(u,v) := \frac{4}{(u^2+v^2+1)^2} \,, \qquad F = 0 \,.
$$
In particualar the fisrt fundamental form is
$$
\mathscr{F}_1 = \lambda(u,v) (du^2 + dv^2) \,.
$$
Define the chart of $\wSSS$: 
$$
\wsss = f \circ \sss \,.
$$
Since $\sss$ is the inverse of $f$, we have that
$$
\wsss(u,v) = (u,v,0) \,.
$$
As already computed, the first fundamental form of $\wsss$ is 
$$
{\wFF}_1 = du^2 + dv^2 \,.
$$
We can now conclude:

1. We have that
$$
{\wFF}_1 = \frac{1}{\lambda} {\FF}_1  \,.
$$
Since $\mathcal{A} = \{\sss\}$ is an atlas for $\SSS$, by Theorem \ref{theorem-conformal-fff} we conclude that $f$ is a conformal map.

2. Since ${\lambda}$ is not always equal to $1$, we have that 
$$
{\wFF}_1 \neq {\FF}_1 \,.
$$
Therefore, by Theorem \ref{theorem-local-isometry}, we conclude that $f$ cannot be a 
local isometry.

::: {.content-hidden}
However, $\sss$ is not equi-areal. Indeed, recall that the first fundamental form of the plane is $du^2 + dv^2$. Therefore the area element of the plane is $1$. 
The area element for $\sss$ is
$$
EG - F^2 =  \frac{16}{(u^2+v^2+1)^4} \neq 1 \,,
$$
showing that $\sss$ is not equi-areal.

### Sphere and Plane are conformal

Consider the plane 
$$

$$ 
with chart
$$
\sss(u,v) := (u,v,0) \,, \quad u,v \in \R \,.
$$
Let $\widetilde{\SSS}$ be the sphere $\sphere^2$ with parametrization
$$
\widetilde{\sss}(u,v) := \left(  \cos(u) \sech(v), \sin(u) \sech(v) , \tanh (v) \right) \,.
$$

1. Compute the first fundamental forms of $\sss$ and $\wsss$.
2. Use Theorem \ref{theorem-conformal-fff-2} to show that $\SSS$ and $\wSSS$ are conformal.


*Solution.* 

1. As already computed, the first fundamental form of $\sss$ is 
$$
\mathscr{F}_1 = du^2 + dv^2 \,.
$$
Using the identitities
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dv} \left( \sech (v)  \right) & = - \sech (v) \tanh (v) \,, \\
\frac{d}{dv} \left( \tanh (v) \right)  & = {\sech}^2 (v) \,,
\end{align*}
we obtain
\begin{align*}
\widetilde{\sss}_u & = ( -\sin(u) \sech(v) , \cos(u)\sech(v) , 0 )  \\
\widetilde{\sss}_v & = ( -\cos(v) \sech(v) \tanh(v) , -\sin(u) \sech(v) \tanh(v) , {\sech}^2(v) )
\end{align*}
By recalling that
$$
{\sech}^2 (v) + {\tanh}^2 (v) = 1 \,,
$$
we compute
\begin{align*}
\widetilde{E} & = \widetilde{\sss}_u \cdot \widetilde{\sss}_u = {\sech}^2(v) (\cos^2(u) + \sin^2(u)) = {\sech}^2(v)  \\ 
\widetilde{F} & = \widetilde{\sss}_u \cdot \widetilde{\sss}_v =  0 \\ 
\widetilde{G} & = \widetilde{\sss}_v \cdot \widetilde{\sss}_v = {\sech}^2(v) ({\tanh}^2(v) + {\sech}^2(v)) = {\sech}^2(u) \\ 
\end{align*}
Hence the first fundamental form of $\widetilde{\SSS}$ is
$$
\widetilde{\mathscr{F}}_1 = {\sech}^2(v) \, \left(  du^2 + dv^2 \right) \,.
$$

2. We have computed that
$$
\widetilde{\mathscr{F}}_1 =  {\sech}^2(v) \, \left(  du^2 + dv^2 \right) =  {\sech}^2(v) \,\mathscr{F}_1 \,.
$$
Since $\sss(U) = \SSS$, by Theorem \ref{theorem-conformal-fff-2}, we conclude that $\SSS$ and $\wSSS$ are conformal.

In the previous section we defined conformal maps between surfaces
$$
f \colon \SSS \to \widetilde{\SSS}\,.

It is also useful to define conformal parametrizations.

::: Definition
### Conformal parametrization {#definition-conformal-parametrization}

Let $\SSS$ be a regular surface and 
$$
\sss \colon U  \to  \SSS
$$ 
be a regular chart of $\SSS$. We say that $\sss$ is a **conformal parametrization** if the first fundamental form of $\sss$ satisfies
$$
\mathscr{F}_1 = \lambda(u,v)  ( du^2 +  dv^2)
$$
for some function $\lambda \colon U \to \R$. 


:::


The above definition is motivated by the following result, stating that $\SSS$ admits a conformal parametrization if and only if $\SSS$ is conformal to a plane.


::: Theorem

Let $\SSS$ be a regular surface and
$$
\sss \colon U  \to  \SSS
$$ 
be a regular chart of $\SSS$. Define the plane $\p$ charted by
$$
\widetilde{\sss} (u,v) = (u,v,0) \,, \quad \forall \, (u,v) \in U \,.
$$

They are equivalent:

1. $\sss$ is a conformal parametrization.

2. There exists a conformal map $f \colon \p \to \sss(U)$.

In particular, angles on $\SSS$ look like angles on the plane, 
in the following sense: Suppose $\g_1, \g_2$ are curves in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ such that
$$
\g_1 (t_0) = \g_2 (t_0) \,.
$$
Consider the corresponding curves on $\SSS$ given by 
$$
\tg_1 := \sss \circ \g_1 \,, \quad \tg_2 = \sss \circ \g_2 \,.
$$
Then 
$$
\theta = \widetilde{\theta} \,,
$$
where 

- $\theta$ is the angle between $\dg_1 (t_0)$ and $\dg_2(t_0)$,
- $\widetilde{\theta}$ is the angle between $\dtg_1 (t_0)$ and $\dtg_2(t_0)$.

::: Proof

*Part 1.*
Define the diffeomorphism $f \colon \p \to \SSS$ by setting
$$
f(u,v,0) = \sss(u,v) \,.
$$
In particular, by definition of $\wsss$, 
$$
f( \widetilde{\sss}(u,v) ) = \sss(u,v) \,.
$$
By Theorem \ref{theorem-conformal-fff} we have that $f$ is a conformal map
if and only if there exists $\lambda \colon \p \to \R$ such that 
$$
{\FF}_1 = \lambda(u,v) \widetilde{\mathscr{F}}_1  \,,
$$
where $\mathscr{F}_1$ and $\widetilde{\mathscr{F}}_1$ are the first fundamental forms of $\sss$ and $\wsss$, respectively. The first fundamental form of $\wsss$ is
$$
\widetilde{\mathscr{F}}_1 = du^2 + dv^2 \,.
$$
Therefore 
$$
\mathscr{F}_1 = \lambda(u,v) \left(   du^2 + dv^2   \right)\,,
$$
showing that $\sss$ is a conformal parametrization. 


*Proof of Point 2.*
Suppose $\sss$ is a conformal parametrization. By the proof of Point 1 we have that 
$$
f \colon \p \to \SSS  \,, \quad f(u,v,0) = \sss(u,v) \,,
$$
is a conformal map. Since $T_{\pp} \p = \R^2$ and $f = \sss$, the thesis follows from the fact that $d_{\pp}f$ preserves angles, since $f$ is a conformal map.

It turns out that all regular surfaces admit an atlas formed by conformal charts.


::: Theorem

Let $\SSS$ be a regular surface. There exists an atlas $\mathcal{A} = \{ \sss_i \}_{i \in I}$ such that each chart $\sss_i \colon U_i \to \SSS$ is conformal, that is, there exists $\lambda_i \colon U \to \R$ such that the first fundamental form of $\sss_i$ is
$$
({{\FF}_i})_1 = \lambda_i(u,v) (du^2 + dv^2 ) \,.
$$
The coordinates $(u,v)$ are called **isothermal**.

:::


The proof of this result is quite technical. For example, a proof is given in the paper [@chern], you can read it [here](https://www.ams.org/journals/proc/1955-006-05/S0002-9939-1955-0074856-1/S0002-9939-1955-0074856-1.pdf). The proof in not constructive, and it involeves showing the existence of solutions to a certain PDE. If $\SSS$ is a minimial surface, existence of isothermal coordinates is easier to prove, see for example Theorem 12.4.1 in [@pressley].


We have already seen conformal parametrizations for both Sphere and Cylinder. we admit conformal parametrizations. Therefore, angles on the Sphere and the Cylinder (with respect to the conformal parametrization) are the same as angles on the plane.


::: Example
### Unit cylinder

Consider the unit cylinder $\SSS$ charted by
$$
\sss (u,v) = (\cos(u), \sin(u), v) \,, \quad u \in (0,2\pi), \, v \in \R \,.
$$
We have proven that the first fundamental form of $\sss$ is
$$
\mathscr{F}_1 = du^2 + dv^2 \,.
$$
Therefore $\sss$ is a conformal parametrization of $\SSS$.

:::




::: Example
### Sphere

Consider the parametrization of the sphere
$$
\sss(u,v) = \left(  \sech(u) \cos(v), \sech(u) \sin(v) , \tanh (u) \right) \,.
$$
In Example \ref{example-conformal} we have seen that the first fundamental form of $\sss$ is
$$
\mathscr{F}_1  = {\sech}(u) \, ( du^2 + dv^2 )  \,.
$$
Therefore $\sss$ is a conformal parametrization of the sphere.


:::




::: Example
### Sphere: Stereographic projection

Consider the parametrization of the sphere
$$
\SSS = \sphere^2 \smallsetminus \{ (1,0,0) \} \,,
$$
given by 
$$
\sss(u,v) =\left( \frac{2u}{u^2+v^2+1},  \frac{2v}{u^2+v^2+1} , 1-\frac{2}{u^2+v^2+1}\right) \,.
$$
We have seen in Example \ref{example-conformal} that $\sss$ can be defined via the stereographic projection. We have also mentioned that the first fundamental form of $\sss$ is
$$
\mathscr{F}_1 = \frac{4}{(u^2+v^2+1)^2} (du^2 + dv^2) \,.
$$
Therefore, $\sss$ is a conformal parametrization of the sphere.

### Areas


Suppose given a regular surface $\SSS$, and consider a region 
$$
R \subseteq \SSS \,.
$$ 
We would like to define the area of $R$, denoted by $\AA(R)$. Recall that, to define length of curves, we approximated the length of $\g$ with the length of piecewise affine approximations $\g_{\e}$ of $\g$. Since $\g_{\e}$ is piecewise affine, we know how to define the length $L(\g_{\e})$ of $\g_{\e}$. We then define the length of $\g$ as
$$
L(\g) = \lim_{\e \to 0} L(\g_\e) \,.
$$
To compute surface areas we could proceed in a similar way: Approximate $R$ with flat regions $R_{\e}$ of which we know how to compute the area, and then define
$$
A(R) = \lim_{\e \to 0} A(R_{\e}) \,.
$$

Theorem 4.2.5 in [@abate-tovena].


![The area $A$ of a small region $R$ on a surface $\SSS$ can be approximated by the area of the rectangle of sides $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$. Such area is $\| \sss_u \times \sss_v \|$.](/images/fff_area.png){#fig-area width=70%}




### Equiarea Maps

![Sketch of equiareal map $f$ between the surfaces $\SSS$ and $\widetilde{\SSS}$. The area of the region $R$ is the same of the area of $f(R)$.](/images/fff_equiareal.png){#fig-equiareal-map width=70%}




### Summary

Let us conclude with a summary for this section. We have introduced the 
**first fundamental form** as the restriction of the euclidean scalar product to the tangent space. The first fundamental form allows to compute:

- Inner product between tangent vectors
- Angle between tangent vectors
- Area of surface regions


In particular we can use the first fundamental form to compute:

- Length of curves on a surface
- Angle between curves on a surface


We have also introduced maps preserving certain quantities:

- Local isometries: They preserve scalar product of tangent vectors, and length of curves
- Conformal maps: They preserve the angle between tangent vectors, and between curves
- Equiareal maps: They preserve areas of surface regions

We have also shown that:

- Conformal maps are local isometries
- Local isometries are not conformal (in general)



### Application: Cartography

Consider the unit sphere
$$
\sphere^2 = \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \, \colon \, x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 \} \,.
$$
To make a map of the Earth one has to define a projection map
$$
\pi \colon \sphere^2 \to \R^2 \,.
$$
As we will see in the next section, the curvatures of $\sphere^2$ and $\R^2$ are different. Consequently each map $\pi$ will induce some *distorsion* in either

- Length
- Angles
- Shapes
- Area 

These types of distorsion can all be present at the same time. There are 2 main types of Earth maps

1. **Conformal projections:** These preserve angles and shapes but change areas. The main examples are
    - Stereographic projection (@fig-stereographic)
    - Mercator projection (@fig-mercator)
    
  
2. **Equiareal projections:** These preserve areas but change angles and shapes. For example:
    - Lambert cylindrical projection (@fig-lambert)


The above mentioned projections admit explicit formulations, and one can actually prove that the corresponding maps are/are not conformal/equi-areal. We will discuss these 3 projections below. Details are left as an exercise. 






::: Example
### Lambert cylindrical projection

Consider the unit sphere
$$
\sphere^2 = \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \, \colon \, x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 \} \,,
$$
and the unit cylinder of equation
$$
x^2 + y^2 = 1 \,.
$$
The sphere is contained inside the cylinder, and the two surfaces touch along the circle $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ in the $\{z=0\}$ plane. Let $P \in \sphere^2$ except for north or south pole. Draw the line through $P$ and the $z$-axis which is parallel to the plane $\{z=0\}$. This line intersects the cylinder in 2 points. Denote by $P'$ the intersection point which is closest to $P$, see @fig-archimedes. To write the projection map explicitly, denote the coordinates of $P$ and $P'$ by
$$
P = (x,y,z) \,, \quad P' = (X,Y,Z) \,.
$$
Since the line through $P$ and $P'$ is parallel to the plane $\{z=0\}$, we have
$$
Z = z \,, \quad (X,Y) = \lambda (x,y)
$$
for some scalar $\lambda$. Using that $P'$ belongs to the cylinder, we get
$$
1 = X^2 + Y^2 = \lambda^2 (x^2 + y^2)
$$
from which we deduce that 
$$
\lambda = \pm \frac{1}{(x^2 + y^2)^{1/2}} \,.
$$ 
Therefore 
$$
X = \lambda x = \pm \frac{x}{(x^2 + y^2)^{1/2}} \,, 
\quad 
Y = \lambda y = \pm \frac{y}{(x^2 + y^2)^{1/2}} \,.
$$
Taking the $+$ sign gives the point
$$
P' = (X,Y,Z) = \left( \frac{x}{(x^2 + y^2)^{1/2}}, \frac{y}{(x^2 + y^2)^{1/2}} ,   z \right) \,.
$$


Consider the chart for the sphere
$$
\sss(u, v)=(\cos (u) \sin (v), \sin (u) \sin (v), \cos (v))
$$


The full calculation will be carried out in Example \ref{example-sphere-principal} below.

:::


::: Example
### Mercator projection

The Mercator projection is a type of cylindrical projection.  Intuitively, it is obtained by blowing up the sphere inside the cylinder, letting the sides of the sphere stick to the cylinder when it comes into contact with it. The main feature of this projection is that parallels and meridians on the Earth become horizontal and vertical lines on the map. This is ideal for navigation. A derivation of the Mercator projection using only elementary geometry is quite involved, see for example this [link](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~israel/m103/mercator/mercator.html). We can however motivate it as follows, using differential geometry. We parametrize the sphere in spherical coordinates 
$$
\sss(\theta,\f)  = 
$$
for $\theta \in (-\pi,\pi)$, $\f \in \left(-\frac{pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}\right)$.

## Second fudamental form



The first fundamental form allows to measure distances on a surface. However it does not give any information on how curved a surface is: For example, we saw that a plane and a cylinder have the 
same first fundamental form
$$
\mathscr{F}_1 = du^2 + dv^2 \,.
$$
However the plane is flat, while the cylinder curves. We would like to find a measure of curvature 
which allows us to tell these two surfaces apart.




We can now start our discussion about curvature of surfaces. We can make a similar argument to the one
we made for curves: If $\g$ is a unit speed curve, the curvature of $\g$ is defined as
$$
\kappa (t) = \norm{\ddg(t)} \,.
$$
The quantity $\kappa(t)$ gave us a measure of how much $\g$ is deviating from a straight line. Similarly, we would like
to quantify how much a surface $\SSS$ is deviating from the tangent plane $T_{\pp} \SSS$. Recall
that 
$$
T_{\pp} \SSS = \operatorname{span} \{ \sss_u , \sss_v \} \,,
$$
where $\sss$ is a regular chart of $\SSS$ at $\pp$. The standard unit normal of $\sss$ is
$$
\NN = \frac{ \sss_u \times \sss_v }{ \norm{\sss_u \times \sss_v } } \,,
$$
which is orthogonal to $T_{\pp} \SSS$. Let $(u_0,v_0) \in \R^2$ be the point such that
$$
\sss(u_0,v_0) = \pp \,.
$$
As the scalar quantities $\Delta u$ and $\Delta v$ vary, the point
$$
\sss ( u_0 + \Delta u , v_0 + \Delta v ) \in \SSS
$$
deviates from the tangent plane $T_{\pp} \SSS$. Since $\NN$ is orthogonal to $T_{\pp} \SSS$, the deviation is given by
$$
\delta := \left[  \sss(  u_0 + \Delta u , v_0 + \Delta v  ) - \sss (u_0,v_0)    \right] \cdot \NN \,,
$$
as shown in @fig-sff-sketch. 

![The point $\sss(u_0 + \Delta u, v_0 + \Delta v)$ on $\SSS$ deviates from $T_{\pp}\SSS$ by a quantity $\delta$.](/images/sff_sketch.png){#fig-sff-sketch width=70%}

Using Taylor's formula we get
\begin{align*}
\sss(u_0 + \Delta u , v_0 + \Delta v)  & = \sss(u_0,v_0) +  \sss_u (u_0,v_0) \, \Delta u + 
                                          \sss_v (u_0,v_0) \, \Delta v  \\
                                       & \,\, +  \frac12 \left(  \sss_{uu}(u_0,v_0) (\Delta u)^2 +  2 \sss_{uv}(u_0,v_0) \Delta u \Delta v  +{\sss}_{vv}(u_0,v_0) (\Delta v)^2    \right) \\ 
                                       &  \,\, + R(\Delta u , \Delta v) \,,
\end{align*}
where $R(\Delta u , \Delta v)$ is a remainder such that
$$
\lim_{\Delta \to 0} \, \frac{R(\Delta u , \Delta v) }{\Delta }  =  0 \,, \quad \Delta := (\Delta u)^2 + (\Delta v)^2 \,. 
$$
Since $\NN$ is orthogonal to $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$, if we multiply the above Taylor expansion by $\NN$, and ignore the remainder, we obtain
$$
\delta =  \frac12 \left(  L  (\Delta u)^2 +  2 M \Delta u \Delta v  + N (\Delta v)^2    \right) \,,
$$
where we set 
$$
L := \sss_{uu}  \cdot \NN \,, \quad 
M := \sss_{uv}  \cdot \NN \,, \quad 
N := \sss_{vv}  \cdot \NN \,.
$$
The expression
$$
\mathscr{F}_2 :=  L \, du^2 +  2 M  \,du dv  + N \, dv^2 
$$
is called the **second fundamental form** of $\SSS$. Therefore $\mathscr{F}_2$ measures how much the surface $\SSS$ deviates from being a plane. Let us make this definition precise.

### SFF and reparametrizations {#remark-sff-reparametrization}

The second fundamental form
$$

depends on the choice of chart $\sss \colon U \to \R^3$. Indeed, let us adopt the same notations 
as Remark \ref{remark-fff-reparametrization}. Suppose that $\widetilde{\sss} \colon \widetilde{U} \to \R^3$ is a reparametrization of $\sss$ with 
$$
\widetilde{\sss} = \sss \circ \Phi \,,

where $\Phi \colon \widetilde{U} \to U$ is a diffeomorphism. Denote the second fundamental form of $\widetilde{\sss}$ by

The matrices of $\mathscr{F}_2$ and $\widetilde{\mathscr{F}}_2$ are related by
$$

Let us show that a plane and a cylinder have different second fundamental forms.



::: Example
### Plane   {#example-sff-plane}

Let $\mathbf{a}, \pp, \mathbf{q} \in \R^3$. Suppose that $\pp$ and $\mathbf{q}$ are orthonormal vectors, that is,
$$
\norm{\pp} = \norm{\mathbf{q}} = 1 \,, \quad \pp \cdot \mathbf{q} = 0 \,. 
$$
Consider the plane with chart
$$
\sss(u,v) = \mathbf{a} + u \pp + v \mathbf{q} \,, \quad (u,v) \in \R^2 \,.
$$
Prove that the second fundamental form of $\sss$ is
$$
\mathscr{F}_2 = 0 \,.
$$
This reflects the intuition that a plane is flat, and therefore there is no *curvature*. 

> We have
$$
\sss_u = \pp \,, \quad \sss_v = \mathbf{q} \,.
$$
The principal unit normal is
$$
\NN = \frac{\pp \times \mathbf{q}}{\norm{ \pp \times \mathbf{q} }   } \,,
$$
while the second derivatives are
$$
\sss_{\uu} = \sss_{\uu} = \sss_{\uu} = \zero \,.
$$
Therefore
\begin{align*}
L & = \sss_{uu} \cdot \NN = 0 \\
M & = \sss_{uv} \cdot \NN = 0 \\
N & = \sss_{vv} \cdot \NN = 0 \\
\end{align*}
and the second fundamental form is
$$
\mathscr{F}_2 = L \, du^2 + 2 M\, du \, dv + N \, dv^2 = 0 \,.  
$$

:::

### Unit cylinder  {#example-cylinder-sff}

Consider the unit cylinder with chart
$$
\sss(u,v) = (\cos(u), \sin(u),  v)  \,, \quad (u,v) \in (0,2\pi) \times \R \,.
$$
Prove that the second fundamental form of $\sss$ is
$$
\mathscr{F}_2 = -  du^2 \,.
$$
This reflects the intuition that the cylinder curves only when moving in the $v$-direction.
In such direction we are moving on a circle of radius $1$, therefore we expect the curvature 
to be $-1$.

> We have
$$
\sss_u = (-\sin(u),\cos(u), 0 )  \,, \quad \sss_v = (0,0,1) \,, 
$$

-\sin(u) & \cos(u) & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1

so that 
$$
\norm{ \sss_u \times \sss_v } = \sqrt{ \cos^2(u) + \sin^2(u)  } = 1 \,. 
$$
The principal unit normal is
$$
\NN = \frac{\sss_u \times \sss_v}{ \norm{\sss_u \times \sss_v} } = (\cos(u), \sin(u),0) \,.
$$
We finally compute
\begin{align*}
L & = \sss_{uu} \cdot \NN \\
  & = (-\cos(u), - \sin(u), 0 ) \cdot (\cos(u), \sin(u),0) \\
  & = - \cos^2(u) - \sin^2(u) = - 1 \\
M & = \sss_{uv} \cdot \NN = 0 \\
N & = \sss_{vv} \cdot \NN = 0 \\

The second fundamental form is
$$
\mathscr{F}_2 = L \, du^2 + 2 M\, du \, dv + N \, dv^2 = - du^2  \,.

::: Remark

We have seen that a plane and the unit cylinder have the same first fundamental form 
$$
\mathscr{F}_1 = \widetilde{\mathscr{F}}_1 = du^2 + dv^2 \,,
$$
while their second fundamental forms differ: we have
$$
\mathscr{F}_2 = 0 \,, \quad \widetilde{\mathscr{F}}_2 = - du^2   \,,

respectively.

### Gauss and Weingarten maps


Another way to quantify how much a surface $\SSS$ is curving is by 
examining the behavior of standard unit normal $\NN$. If 
$\SSS$ is a plane spanned by vectors $\pp$ and $\mathbf{q}$, then its standard unit normal is
$$
\NN = \frac{\pp \times \mathbf{q}}{ \norm{\pp \times \mathbf{q}} } \,,
$$
which is constant across $\SSS$. If $\SSS$ is a general surface, measuring the variation of $\NN$ will tell us how much $\SSS$ is deviating from being a plane. This
is the idea behind the definition of the **Gauss** and **Weingarten** maps.


::: Remark 

Let $\SSS$ be oriented and $\NN \colon \SSS \to \R^3$ be the standard unit normal. In particular $\NN$ is a smooth map and 
$$
\NN(\pp) \perp T_{\pp} \SSS \,, \quad \| \NN(\pp) \| = 1 \,, \quad \forall  \, \pp \in \SSS \,. 
$$
Since $T_{\pp} \SSS$ passes through the origin and $\NN$ has norm $1$, it follows that
$$
\NN (\pp) \in 
\sphere^2 := \{ \xx \in \R^3 \, \colon \, \| \xx \| = 1 \}  \,,
$$
where $\sphere^2$ is the unit sphere in $\R^3$. Thus $\NN \colon \SSS \to \sphere^2$.

:::




::: Definition
### Gauss map

Let $\SSS$ be an oriented surface and $\NN$ the standard unit normal to $\SSS$. The **Gauss map** of 
$\SSS$ is the map 
$$
{\mathcal{G}}_{\SSS} \colon \SSS  \to \sphere^2 \,, \quad 
{\mathcal{G}}_{\SSS} (\pp):= \NN(\pp) \,.
$$

::: {.Remark #remark-gauss-coordinates}

The Gauss map of $\SSS$ is just the standard unit normal of $\SSS$. By definition
of standard unit normal to $\SSS$ we obtain that 
$$
\mathcal{G}_{\SSS} \circ \sss = \NN
$$
for all charts $\sss \colon U \to \R^3$, where $\NN = \NN_{\sss}$ is the standard unit normal to $\sss$,
that is, 
$$
\NN \colon U \to \R^3 \,, \quad 
\NN := \frac{ \sss_u \times \sss_v }{ \norm{ \sss_u \times \sss_v } } \,.
$$


:::


::: Example

1. Suppose $\SSS$ is the unit sphere $\sphere^2$. Then 
${\mathcal{G}}_{\SSS} \colon \SSS \to \sphere^2$ is the identity, see @fig-gauss-sphere.

2. Let $\mathbf{a} , \vv ,\ww \in \R^3$ with $\vv$ and $\ww$ linearly independent.
Let $\SSS$ be the plane 
$$
\sss (u,v):= \mathbf{a} + \vv u + \mathbf{\ww} v \,, \quad \forall \, (u,v) \in \R^2 \,.
$$
The Gauss map of $\SSS$ is constant:
$$
\mathcal{G}_{\SSS} (\pp) = \frac{ \vv \times \ww  }{ \| \vv \times \ww \| } \,,
$$
for all $\pp \in \SSS$, see @fig-gauss-plane.

3. Let $\SSS$ be the unit cylinder
$$
\sss(u,v) = (\cos(u), \sin(u),  v)  \,, \quad (u,v) \in (0,2\pi) \times \R \,.
$$
Then
$$
\sss_u = (-\sin(u),\cos(u), 0 )  \,, \quad \sss_v = (0,0,1) \,,
$$
and
$$
\sss_u \times \sss_v = 
\left|
\begin{array}{ccc}
\ii & \jj & \kk \\
-\sin(u) & \cos(u) & 0 \\
0  &  0 &  1 
\end{array}
\right|
= (\cos(u), \sin(u), 0) \,.
$$
Therefore 
$$
\norm{ \sss_u \times \sss_v } = 1 \,,
$$
and 
$$

$$
The Gauss map of $\SSS$ is
$$
\mathcal{G}_{\SSS} (\pp) = (\cos(u_0), \sin(u_0), 0) \,,
$$
where $(u_0,v_0)$ is such that $\sss(u_0,v_0)=\pp$. 
Note that $\mathcal{G}_{\SSS}$ maps $\SSS$ into the equator of $\sphere^2$, see @fig-gauss-cylinder.

::: Definition
### Weingarten map

Let $\SSS$ be an orientable surface and $\mathcal{G} \colon \SSS \to \sphere^2$ its Gauss map. 
The **Weingarten map** $\WW_{\pp, \SSS}$ of $\SSS$ at $\pp$ is the negative differential of the 
Gauss map at $\pp$, that is,
$$
\WW_{\pp,\SSS} \colon T_{\pp}\SSS  \to T_{\pp} \SSS \,, \quad  \WW_{\pp,\SSS}(\vv) := -d_{\pp} \mathcal{G} (\vv) \,,
$$
for all $\vv \in T_{\pp} \SSS$.

:::


::: Important

The Gauss map encodes information on the standard unit normal $\NN$ to $\SSS$. Hence its derivative, the Weingarten map, detects the rate of change of $\NN$.

:::

::: Remark

The minus sign in the definition of $\WW_{\pp,\SSS}$ is a convention, just like we defined the torsion
to be the scalar $\tau$ such that
$$
\dot{\bb} = - \tau \nn \,.
$$

:::

The Weingarten map allows us to define a bilnear form on $T_{\pp} \SSS$. We call such bilinear form the **second fundamental form** of $\SSS$. 


::: Definition
### Second fundamental form of a surface


Let $\SSS$ be an orientable surface and denote by 
$$
\WW_{\pp,\SSS} \colon T_{\pp} \SSS \to T_{\pp} \SSS 
$$
its Weingarten map at $\pp$. The **second fundamental form** of $\SSS$ at $\pp$ is the map
$$
II_{\pp} \colon T_{\pp} \SSS \times T_{\pp} \SSS \to \R
$$ 
defined by
$$
II_{\pp}(\vv,\ww) := \WW_{\pp, \SSS}(\vv) \cdot \ww \,, \quad \forall \, \vv , \ww \in T_{\pp} \SSS \,.
$$

:::

::: Remark

The second fudamental form $II_{\pp}$ of $\SSS$ is bilinear. 

> Indeed, $\WW_{\pp,\SSS}$ is linear, being the differential of a smooth map. Hence $II_{\pp}$ is bilinear, given that the scalar product is bilinear.

:::


::: Remark 
### Matrix of the second fundamental form


Let $\sss$ be a chart at $\pp \in \SSS$. Since $II_{\pp}$ is a bilinear form on 
$T_{\pp} \SSS$, it can be represented by the $2 \times 2$ matrix 
$$
A = 
\left( 
\begin{array}{cc}
II_{\pp} (\sss_u, \sss_u) & II_{\pp} (\sss_u , \sss_v) \\
II_{\pp} (\sss_v, \sss_u) & II_{\pp} (\sss_v , \sss_v) 
\end{array}
\right)  \,,
$$
given that $\{ \sss_u, \sss_v\}$ is a basis for $T_{\pp} \SSS$. In a not so shocking turn of events, it happens that
$$
A = \mathscr{F}_2 = 
\left( 
\begin{array}{cc}
L & M \\
M & N 
\end{array}
\right) 
$$
where
$$
L = \sss_{uu} \cdot \NN \,, \quad 
M = \sss_{uv} \cdot \NN \,, \quad 
N = \sss_{vv} \cdot \NN \,.
$$
Therefore, the second fundamental form $II_{\pp}$ coincides with the second fundamental form $\mathscr{F}_{2}$ of the chart $\sss$. We prove this statement in the next theorem.

:::


::: {.Theorem #theorem-sff-chart }

Let $\SSS$ be an orientable surface and $\sss \colon U \to \R^3$ be a regular chart.
Let $\pp \in \sss(U)$. 

1. The second funamental form $II_{\pp}$ is a symmetric bilinear map.

2. It holds
$$
II_{\pp} (\vv,\ww) = (du (\vv), dv(\vv) )  \, 
\left( 
\begin{array}{cc}
L & M \\
M & N 
\end{array}
\right) \, (du(\ww) , dv(\ww))^T \,,
$$
for all $\vv,\ww \in T_{\pp} \SSS$, where
$$
L = \sss_{uu} \cdot \NN \,, \quad 
M = \sss_{uv} \cdot \NN \,, \quad 
N = \sss_{vv} \cdot \NN \,.
$$

3. $\mathscr{F}_2$ is the quadratic form associated to $II_{\pp}$, that is,
$$
\mathscr{F}_2 (\vv) = {II}_{\pp} (\vv,\vv) \,, \quad \forall \, \vv \in T_{\pp} \SSS \,.
$$


:::


To prove Theorem \ref{theorem-sff-chart} we use the following two Lemmas.


::: {.Lemma  #lemma-normal-derivatives}

Let $\sss \colon U \to \R^3$ be a regular chart with standard unit normal $\NN \colon U \to \R^3$. 
Then
\begin{align*}
\NN_{u} \cdot \sss_u & = - L \,,\\
\NN_{u} \cdot \sss_v & = \NN_{v} \cdot \sss_u = - M \,, \\
\NN_{v} \cdot \sss_v & = - N \,.
\end{align*}

:::


::: Proof

The vectors $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ form a basis for $T_{\pp} \SSS$. Since $\NN$ is orthogonal to 
$T_{\pp} \SSS$ by definition, it follows that
$$
\NN \cdot \sss_u = 0 \,, \quad 
\NN \cdot \sss_v = 0 \,.
$$
Differentiating the above with respect to $u$ and $v$ yields the thesis. For example, we have
$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial u} (\NN \cdot \sss_u) = 0 \,.
$$
On the other hand, by chain rule,
$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial u} (\NN \cdot \sss_u) = \NN_u \cdot \sss_u + \NN \cdot \sss_{uu} = 
\NN_u \cdot \sss_u + L \,,
$$
from which we infer
$$
\NN_u \cdot \sss_u = - L \,.
$$
The rest of the proof follows similarly.

:::


::: {.Lemma  #lemma-weingarten}

Let $\SSS$ be an orientable surface and $\WW_{\pp,\SSS} \colon T_{\pp} \SSS \to T_{\pp} \SSS$ be 
its Weingarten map at $\pp$. Let $\sss$ be a regular chart at $\pp$, with $\sss(u_0,v_0) = \pp$. Then
$$
\WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\sss_u) = - \NN_u \,, \quad 
\WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\sss_v) = - \NN_v \,,
$$
where $\sss_u,\sss_v,\NN_u,\NN_v$ are evaluated at $(u_0,v_0)$.

:::


::: Proof

Since $\WW_{\pp,\SSS}$ is defined as $- d_{\pp} \mathcal{G}_{\SSS}$, we can compute 
$\WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\sss_u)$ and $\WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\sss_v)$ by using the definition of differential of
a smooth function. To this end, consider the curve
$$
\g (t) := \sss ( u_0 + t , v_0 ) \,.
$$
We have that $\g$ is a smooth curve in $\SSS$ and
$$
\dg(t) =  \sss_u( u_0 + t, v_0 ) \,.
$$
Therefore
$$
\g(0) = \sss(u_0,v_0) = \pp \,, \quad \dg(0) = \sss_u (u_0,v_0) \,.
$$
Define
$$
\tg(t) := (\mathcal{G}_{\SSS} \circ \g )(t) \,.
$$
By Remark \ref{remark-gauss-coordinates}
$$
\tg(t) = \mathcal{G}_{\SSS} (\g(t)) = \mathcal{G}_{\SSS} (\sss(u_0 + t , v_0)) = \NN (u_0 + t , v_0) \,.
$$
Thus
$$
\dtg(t) = \NN_u (u_0 + t , v_0) \,, \quad \dtg(0) = \NN_u (u_0 , v_0) \,.
$$
By definition of differential, we have
$$
\WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\sss_u)  = - d_{\pp} \mathcal{G}_{\SSS} (\sss_u) 
                         = - \dtg (0) 
                         = - \NN_u (u_0,v_0) \,,
$$
as we wanted to prove. To show that
$$
\WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\sss_v) = - \NN_v (u_0,v_0) \,,
$$
it is sufficient to consider the curve
$$
\g (t) := \sss ( u_0 , v_0 + t ) \,,
$$
and argue similarly. This is left as an exercise.


:::


We can now prove Theorem \ref{theorem-sff-chart}


::: Proof
### Proof of Theorem \ref{theorem-sff-chart}

By Theorem \ref{theorem-tangent-plane} we have
$$
T_{\pp} \SSS = \operatorname{span} \{ \sss_u, \sss_v \} \,.
$$
Therefore, for $\vv,\ww \in T_{\pp} \SSS$, there exist $\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\mu_1,\mu_2 \in \R$ such that 
$$
\vv = \lambda_1 \sss_u + \mu_1 \sss_v \,, \quad 
\ww = \lambda_2 \sss_u + \mu_2 \sss_v \,.
$$
By bilinearity of $II_{\pp}$ we infer
\begin{align*}
{II}_{\pp} (\vv,\ww) & = \lambda_1 \lambda_2 \, II_{\pp}(\sss_u , \sss_u)  +  \lambda_1 \mu_2 \,  II_{\pp}(\sss_u , \sss_v) \\ 
& \,\,\,\, + \lambda_2 \mu_1  \,  II_{\pp}(\sss_v , \sss_u)  + \mu_1 \mu_2 \,  II_{\pp}(\sss_v , \sss_v) \\
& = du(\vv) du(\ww) \, II_{\pp}(\sss_u , \sss_u)  +  du(\vv) dv(\ww) \,  II_{\pp}(\sss_u , \sss_v) \\ 
& \,\,\,\, + dv(\vv) du(\vv)  \,  II_{\pp}(\sss_v , \sss_u)  + dv(\vv) dv(\ww) \,  II_{\pp}(\sss_v , \sss_v) \\
& = (du (\vv), dv(\vv) )  \, 
\left( 
\begin{array}{cc}
II_{\pp}(\sss_u , \sss_u) & II_{\pp}(\sss_u , \sss_v) \\
II_{\pp}(\sss_v , \sss_u) & II_{\pp}(\sss_v , \sss_v) 
\end{array}
\right) \, (du(\ww) , dv(\ww))^T \,.
\end{align*}
By Lemma \ref{lemma-weingarten} and Lemma \ref{lemma-normal-derivatives} we have
$$
\WW_{\pp, \SSS} (\sss_u) = - \NN_u \,, \quad L = - \NN_u \cdot \sss_u \,.
$$
Therefore, using the above and the definition of $II_{\pp}$, we get
$$
II_{\pp} (\sss_u,\sss_u) = \WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\sss_u) \cdot \sss_u = - \NN_u \cdot \sss_u = L \,.
$$
With similar calculations we obtain 
$$
II_{\pp} (\sss_u,\sss_v) = II_{\pp} (\sss_v,\sss_u) = M \,, \quad
II_{\pp} (\sss_v,\sss_v) = N \,,
$$
concluding the proof of point 2. In particular this also proves that $II_{\pp}$ is symmetric, which is Point 1 of the statement. The fact that 
$$
II_{\pp}(\vv,\vv) = \mathscr{F}_2(\vv)
$$ 
follows from Point 2 and definition of $\mathscr{F}_2$.

### Matrix of Weingarten map


The Weingarten map is a linear map
$$
\WW_{\pp,\SSS} \colon T_{\pp} \SSS \to T_{\pp} \SSS \,.
$$
We would like to find a formula to compute $\WW_{\pp,\SSS}$. This is easily done: Given a chart $\sss$ at $\pp$, we have that $\{\sss_u,\sss_v\}$ is a basis 
for the vector space $T_{\pp} \SSS$. Therefore there exists a $2 \times 2$ matrix $A$
which represents $\WW_{\pp,\SSS}$, that is, 
$$
\WW_{\pp,\SSS}(\vv) = A \vv \,, \quad \forall \, \vv \in T_{\pp} \SSS \,.
$$
It turns out that
$$
A = \mathscr{F}_1^{-1} \mathscr{F}_2 \,,
$$
where we recall that
$$
\mathscr{F}_1 =
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
E & F \\
F & G
\end{array}
\right)\,, \quad 
\mathscr{F}_2 =
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
L & M \\
M & N
\end{array}
\right) \,,
$$
where
\begin{align*}
E & = \sss_u \cdot \sss_u \,, & F & =  \sss_u \cdot \sss_v \, , & G & =  \sss_v \cdot \sss_v \,,  \\
L & = \sss_{uu} \cdot \NN \, ,  & M & =  \sss_{uv} \cdot \NN \,, & N & =  \sss_{vv} \cdot \NN \,, 
\end{align*}
and
$$
\NN = \frac{ \sss_u \times \sss_v }{ \norm{ \sss_u \times \sss_v } } \,.
$$
Let us prove this claim.


::: Theorem
### Matrix of Weingarten map  {#theorem-weingarten}

Let $\SSS$ be an orientable surface and $\WW_{\pp,\SSS} \colon T_{\pp} \SSS \to T_{\pp} \SSS$ be 
its Weingarten map at $\pp$. Let $\sss$ be a regular chart at $\pp$, with $\sss(u_0,v_0) = \pp$. Then
$$
\WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\vv) = \mathscr{F}_1^{-1} \mathscr{F}_2   \left(
\begin{array}{c}

\right)\,, \quad \forall \, v \in T_{\pp} \SSS \,,
$$
where 
$$
\vv = \lambda \sss_u + \mu \sss_v \,,
$$
with $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ evaluated at $(u_0,v_0)$.

:::

::: Proof

By Theorem \ref{theorem-tangent-plane} we know that $\{\sss_u,\sss_v\}$ is a basis of 
$T_{\pp} \SSS$. Since $\WW_{\pp,\SSS} \colon T_{\pp} \SSS \to T_{\pp} \SSS$ is linear, by standard linear algebra results there exist coefficients $a,b,c,d \in \R$ such that
$$
\WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\vv) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{cc} 
a & b \\
c & d
\end{array}
\right) 
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
\lambda \\
\mu
\end{array}
\right)\, \quad \forall \, \vv \in T_{\pp} \SSS \,,
$$
where
$$
\vv = \lambda \sss_u + \mu \sss_v \,.
$$
The coefficients $a,b,c,d \in \R$ can be compute by solving the linear system
\begin{align*}
\WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\sss_u) & = a \sss_u + b \sss_v \\
\WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\sss_v) & = c \sss_u + d \sss_v \,.
\end{align*}
By Lemma \ref{lemma-weingarten} we have
$$
\WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\sss_u) = - \NN_u \,, \quad 
\WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\sss_v) = - \NN_v \,,
$$
so that we obtain
\begin{align*}
- \NN_u & = a \sss_u + b \sss_v \\
- \NN_v & = c \sss_u + d \sss_v \,.
\end{align*}
Taking the scalar product of the above equations with $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ we get
\begin{align*}
- \NN_u \cdot \sss_u & = a (\sss_u \cdot \sss_u) + b (\sss_v \cdot \sss_u) \\
- \NN_u \cdot \sss_v & = a (\sss_u \cdot \sss_v) + b (\sss_v \cdot \sss_v) \\
- \NN_v \cdot \sss_u & = c (\sss_u \cdot \sss_u) + d (\sss_v \cdot \sss_u) \\
- \NN_v \cdot \sss_v & = c (\sss_u \cdot \sss_v) + d (\sss_v \cdot \sss_v) 
\end{align*}
By Lemma \ref{lemma-normal-derivatives} we have
\begin{align*}
\NN_u \cdot \sss_u & = - L \,,  & \NN_u \cdot \sss_v & = - M \,, \\
\NN_v \cdot \sss_u & = - M \,,  & \NN_v \cdot \sss_v & = - N \,. \\
\end{align*}
If in addition we recall the definition of $E,F,G$, we obtain
\begin{align*}
L & = a E + b F \\
M & = a F + b G \\
M & = c E + d F \\
N & = c F + d G 
\end{align*}
The above equations are equivalent to the matrix multiplication
$$
\left(
\begin{array}{cc} 
L & M \\
M & N
\end{array}
\right)
=
\left(
\begin{array}{cc} 
a & b \\
c & d
\end{array}
\right)
\left(
\begin{array}{cc} 
E & F \\
F & G
\end{array}
\right) \,,
$$
which reads
$$
\mathscr{F}_1 A = \mathscr{F}_2 \,.
$$
Now, notice that 
$$
\det \mathscr{F}_1 > 0 \,.
$$

> Indeed, recall Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:
$$
\vv \cdot \vv \leq \| \vv \| \| \ww \| \,, \quad \forall \, \vv , \ww \in 
\R^3 \,,
$$
where the inequality is strict if and only if $\vv$ and $\ww$ are linearly independent. Since $\SSS$ is regular, we have that 
$\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ are linearly independent. Therefore by Cauchy-Schwarz 
we have 
$$
\sss_u \cdot \sss_v  < \norm{ \sss_u } \norm{\sss_v} \,,
$$
and so, squaring both sides,
$$
\left( \sss_u \cdot \sss_v \right)^2 < \norm{ \sss_u }^2 \norm{\sss_v}^2 \,.
$$
Hence
\begin{align*}
\det (\mathscr{F}_1) & = EG-F^2 \\
                     & =  \left(\sss_u \cdot \sss_u  \right) \left(\sss_v \cdot \sss_v  \right)  -  \left(\sss_u \cdot \sss_v \right)^2  \\
                     & = \norm{ \sss_u }^2 \norm{\sss_v}^2 - \left(\sss_u \cdot \sss_v \right)^2 > 0 \,.
\end{align*}


In particular the matrix $\mathscr{F}_1$ is invertible and thus
$$
A = \mathscr{F}_1^{-1} \mathscr{F}_2 \,,
$$
concluding the proof.

:::


::: Important

A matrix $A \in \R^{n \times n}$ is invertible if and only if $\det (A) \neq 0$. In such case
the inverse $A^{-1}$ is computed via the formula
$$
A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det (A)} \, \operatorname{cof}(A)^T \,,
$$
where $\operatorname{cof}(A)$ is the cofactor matrix of $A$. For $n=2$ the above formula
reads:
$$
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
a & b \\
c & d 
\end{array}
\right)^{-1}
=
\frac{1}{ad - bc}  \,
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
d & -b \\
-c & a 
\end{array}
\right) \,.
$$
If the matrix is diagonal, then 
$$
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
\lambda & 0 \\
0 & \mu 
\end{array}
\right) 
=
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
1/\lambda & 0 \\
0 & 1/\mu 
\end{array}

$$


:::



::: Notation

In the following we denote the matrix of $\WW_{\pp,\SSS}$ by the symbol $\WW$.

:::



::: Example
### Helicoid

The Helicoid is charted by
$$
\sss (u,v) = (u \cos (v), u \sin(v) , \lambda v) \,, \quad u \in [0,1] \,, \, v \in [0,4\pi) \,,
$$
where $\lambda>0$ is a constant, see @fig-helicoid. Prove that the matrix of the Weingarten map is
$$
\WW = 
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
0 & - \dfrac{\lambda}{(u^2 + \lambda^2)^{1/2}} \\
\dfrac{\lambda}{(u^2 + \lambda^2)^{3/2}} & 0 
\end{array}
\right) \,.
$$


*Solution.* We compute
\begin{align*}
\sss_u & = ( \cos(v), \sin(v), 0  )  \\
\sss_v & = ( - u \sin(v), u \cos(v), \lambda  )  \\
\sss_{uu} & = ( 0, 0, 0  )  \\
\sss_{uv} & = (- \sin(v), \cos(v), 0 ) \\
\sss_{vv} & = ( - u \cos(v), - u \sin(v), 0 ) \\
\end{align*}
from which
\begin{align*}
E & = \sss_u \cdot \sss_u = 1 \\
F & = \sss_u \cdot \sss_v = 0 \\
G & = \sss_v \cdot \sss_v = u^2 + \lambda^2 \,, 
\end{align*}
so that the first fundamental form is
$$
\mathscr{F}_1 = 
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
E & F \\
F & G 
\end{array}
\right)
=
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0 \\
0 & u^2 + \lambda^2 
\end{array}
\right) \,.
$$
Since $\mathscr{F}_1$ is diagonal, the inverse is immediately computed
$$
\mathscr{F}_1^{-1}
=
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0 \\
0 & \dfrac{1}{u^2 + \lambda^2}
\end{array}
\right) \,.
$$
Moreover
\begin{align*}
\sss_u \times \sss_v & = 
\left|
\begin{array}{ccc}
\ii & \jj & \kk \\
\cos(v)  &  \sin(v)  &  0 \\
-u \sin(v) & u \cos(v) & \lambda 
\end{array}
\right| \\
& =
(\lambda \sin (v), - \lambda \cos(v), u)
\end{align*}
and so
$$
\norm{\sss_u \times \sss_v} = \sqrt{u^2 + \lambda^2} \,.
$$
The standard unit normal to $\sss$ is 
$$
\NN  = \frac{ \sss_u \times \sss_v }{ \norm{\sss_u \times \sss_v} } = 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{u^2 + \lambda^2}} \, (\lambda \sin(v), -\lambda \cos(v), u) \,.
$$
Hence
\begin{align*}
L & = \sss_{uu} \cdot \NN = 0 \\
M & = \sss_{uv} \cdot \NN = - \frac{\lambda}{\sqrt{u^2 + \lambda^2}} \\
N & = \sss_{vv} \cdot \NN = 0 \\
\end{align*}
and the second funamental form $\mathscr{F}_2$ is
$$
\mathscr{F}_2 = 
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
L & M \\
M & N 
\end{array}
\right)
=
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
0 & - \dfrac{\lambda}{\sqrt{u^2 + \lambda^2}} \\
- \dfrac{\lambda}{\sqrt{u^2 + \lambda^2}} & 0
\end{array}
\right) \,.
$$
Finally
\begin{align*}
\WW & = \mathscr{F}_1^{-1} \mathscr{F}_2 \\
    & =
\left( 
\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0 \\
0 & \dfrac{1}{u^2 + \lambda^2}
\end{array}
\right)    
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
0 & - \dfrac{\lambda}{\sqrt{u^2 + \lambda^2}} \\
- \dfrac{\lambda}{\sqrt{u^2 + \lambda^2}} & 0
\end{array}
\right) \\
& = 
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
0 & - \dfrac{\lambda}{(u^2 + \lambda^2)^{1/2}} \\
\dfrac{\lambda}{(u^2 + \lambda^2)^{3/2}} & 0 
\end{array}
\right) \,.

Find the Weingarten matrix of the following surface chart
$$
\sss (u, v) = \left(u-v, u+v, u^{2}+v^{2}\right) \,.
$$

*Solution*. Start by computing the first fundamental form:
\begin{align*}
\sss_{u} & =(1,1,2u) \\
\sss_{v} & =(-1,1,2v) \\  
E & = \sss_{u} \cdot \sss_u  = 2 (1+2u^2) \\
F & = \sss_{u} \cdot \sss_v  = 4uv \\
G & = \sss_{v} \cdot \sss_v  = 2 (1+2v^2) 
\end{align*}
so that
$$
\mathscr{F}_{1}=
\left(
  \begin{array}{ll}
E & F \\
F & G
\end{array}
\right)
=
\left(\begin{array}{ll}
2(1 + 2u^2) & 4uv \\
4uv & 2(1 + 2v^2)
\end{array}\right)
$$
The determinant of $\mathscr{F}_1$ is
$$
\det (\mathscr{F}_1) = 4 (1+2u^2 + 2v^2)
$$
and therefore
\begin{align*}
\mathscr{F}_{1}^{-1} & = \frac{1}{\det (\mathscr{F}_1)} 
\left(
  \begin{array}{ll}
G & -F \\
-F & E
\end{array}
\right) \\
& = \frac{1}{2(1 + 2u^2 + 2v^2)}
\,\left(\begin{array}{ll}
1 + 2v^2 & -2uv \\
- 2uv & 1 + 2u^2
\end{array}\right) \,.
\end{align*}
We now need to compute the second fundamental form
\begin{align*}
\sss_{u u} & =(0,0,2) \\
\sss_{u v} & =(0,0,0) \\
\sss_{v v} & =(0,0,2) \\
\sss_{u} \times \sss_{v} & =\left|\begin{array}{ccc}
\ii & \jj & \kk \\
1 & 1 & 2 u \\
-1 & 1 & 2 v
\end{array}\right| \\
& =2(v-u,-u-v, 1) \\
\left\|\sss_{u} \times \sss_{v}\right\| & =2\left( 1 + 2u^2 + 2v^2\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} \\
\NN & =\frac{(v-u,-u-v, 1)}{ \left( 1 + 2 u^2 + 2 v^2 \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}} \\
L & = \sss_{uu} \cdot \NN =\frac{2}{\left( 1 + 2u^{2}+ 2v^{2}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}} \\
M & = \sss_{uv} \cdot \NN = 0 \\
N & = \sss_{vv} \cdot \NN = \frac{2}{\left(1 + 2u^{2}+ 2v^{2}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}}
\end{align*}
so that
\begin{align*}
\mathscr{F}_{2} & =
\left(\begin{array}{ll}
L & M \\
M & N
\end{array}\right) \\
& =
\frac{2}{\left( 1 + 2u^{2}+ 2v^{2}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}} \, \left(\begin{array}{ll}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{array}\right) \,.
\end{align*}
The matrix of the Weingarten map is
\begin{align*}
\WW & = \mathscr{F}_1^{-1} \mathscr{F}_2 \\
& = 
\frac{1}{(1 + 2u^2 + 2v^2)^{\frac32}}
\,\left(\begin{array}{ll}
1 + 2v^2 & -2uv \\
- 2uv & 1 + 2u^2

## Curvatures


Curvatures of a surface $\SSS$ are scalars associated to the Weingarten 
map $\WW_{\pp,\SSS}$. We will define:

- Gaussian curvature
- Mean curvature
- Principal curvatures
- Normal curvature
- Geodesic curvature



### Gaussian and mean curvature


The Weingarten map of $\SSS$ encodes the rate of change of the standard unit normal
$\NN$. We use this map to produce scalar values, which we call **curvatures**. The
first two curvatures that we consider are called **Gaussian** and **mean** curvatures.



::: Definition
### Gaussian and mean curvature

Let $\SSS$ be an orientable surface and let $\WW$ denote the matrix of
the Weingarten map $\WW_{\pp,\SSS}$ of $\SSS$ at $\pp$. We define:

- The **Gaussian curvature** of $\SSS$ at $\pp$ as
$$
K := \det (\WW) \,,
$$

- The **mean curvature** of $\SSS$ at $\pp$ as
$$
H := \frac12 \, \operatorname{trace} (\WW) \,,
$$

:::


::: Notation
### Trace of a $2 \times 2$ matrix

We recall that the **trace** of a $2 \times 2$ matrix $A$ is defined as the sum of the diagonal
entries, that is,
$$
\operatorname{trace} A = a + d \,, \quad
A = 
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{array}
\right) \,.
$$

:::


::: Remark

The Gaussian curvature and mean curvature do not depend on the choice of basis of $T_{\pp} \SSS$. Indeed, if $\widetilde{\WW}$ is the 
matrix of the Weingarten map with respect to the basis $\{\widetilde{\sss}_u,\widetilde{\sss}_v\}$ of $T_{\pp} \SSS$, then 
$$
\det (\WW) = \det (\widetilde{\WW}) \,, \quad 
\operatorname{trace} (\WW) = \operatorname{trace} (\widetilde{\WW}) \,.
$$

> The above is true by a general linear algebra result: The determinant and trace of a matrix are invariant under change of basis.

:::


Since we have shown that the matrix of the Weingarten map is
$$
\WW = \mathscr{F}_1^{-1} \mathscr{F}_2 \,,
$$
we can express $K$ and $H$ in terms of the first and second fundamental forms.


::: Proposition

Let $\SSS$ be an orientable surface and $\sss$ a regular chart at $\pp$. Then
$$
K =
\frac{ LN-M^2 }{ EG - F^2 } \,, \quad 
H = 
\frac{LG - 2MF - NE}{2 (EG - F^2)} \,.
$$

:::


::: Proof

By Theorem \ref{theorem-weingarten} the matrix of the Weingarten map $\WW_{\pp,\SSS}$ of $\SSS$ at $\pp$ is given by
$$
\WW = \mathscr{F}_1^{-1} \mathscr{F}_2 \,.
$$
We have
\begin{align*}
\det (\mathscr{F}_1) & = 
 \left|
\begin{array}{cc}
E & F \\
F & G
\end{array}
\right| = EF - G^2 \,, \\
\det (\mathscr{F}_2) & = 
 \left|
\begin{array}{cc}
L & M \\
M & N
\end{array}
\right| = LN - M^2 \,.
\end{align*}
By the properties of determinant we get
$$
\det (\mathscr{F}_1^{-1}) = \frac{1}{\det (\mathscr{F}_1)} = \frac{1}{EF - G^2} \,,
$$
and therefore
\begin{align*}
K & = \det (\WW)  = \det \left( \mathscr{F}_1^{-1} \mathscr{F}_2 \right) \\
  & =  \det (\mathscr{F}_1^{-1})  \det (\mathscr{F}_2)
= \frac{ LN-M^2 }{ EG - F^2 } \, .
\end{align*}
To compute $H$ we need to find the diagonal entries of $\WW$. Since 
$$
\mathscr{F}_1^{-1} = 
\frac{1}{EG - F^2} 
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
G & -F \\
-F & E
\end{array}
\right) 
$$
we have
$$
\WW = \frac{1}{EG - F^2} 
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
G & -F \\
-F & E
\end{array}
\right) 
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
L & M \\
M & N
\end{array}
\right) \,.
$$
From the above we compute
\begin{align*}
w_{11} & = \frac{1}{EG - F^2} \left( LG - MF  \right) \\
w_{22} & = \frac{1}{EG - F^2} \left( -MF + EN  \right) \\
\end{align*}
Therefore
\begin{align*}
H & = \frac12 \operatorname{trace} \WW \\
  & = \frac12 \left (w_{11} + w_{22} \right) \\
  & = \frac{LG - 2MF + EN}{2 (EG - F^2)}  \,.
\end{align*}

### Plane

Consider the plane charted by
$$
\sss (u,v) = \mathbf{a} + \pp u + \mathbf{q} v \,, \quad u \in (0,2\pi)\,, \, u, v \in \R \,.
$$
We have already computed in Example \ref{example-fff-plane} and Example \ref{example-sff-plane} that the first and second
fundamental forms of $\sss$ are
$$
\mathscr{F}_1 =
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{array}
\right) \,, \quad 
\mathscr{F}_2 =
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
0 & 0 \\
0 & 0
\end{array}
\right) \,.
$$
Therefore the matrix of the Weingarten map is
$$
\WW  = \mathscr{F}_1^{-1} \mathscr{F}_2 
= 
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
0 & 0 \\
0 & 0
\end{array}
\right)  \,.
$$
Hence the Gaussian curvature is
$$
K = \det (\WW) = 0 \,,
$$
while the mean curvature is
$$
H = \frac12 \, \operatorname{trace} \WW =  0 \,.
$$

H = \frac12 \, \operatorname{trace} \WW =  - \frac12 \,.

### Principal curvatures

Let $V$ be a two-dimensional vector space.
For a linear map $L \colon V \to V$ we say that $\lambda \in \R$ is an **eigenvalue** of $L$ with **eigenvector** $\vv \in V$ if
$$
L(\vv)  = \lambda \vv \,, \quad \vv \neq 0 \,.
$$
Suppose $A \in \R^{2 \times 2}$ is the matrix of $L$ with respect to a basis $\{\vv_1,\vv_2\}$
of $V$. Denote by 
$$
\xx= (\lambda,\mu) \,, \quad 
\vv = \lambda \ww_1 + \mu \ww_2 \,.
$$ 
the vector of coordinates of $\vv$. Then
$$
A\vv = \lambda \vv \,,
$$
meaning that $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A$ with eigenvector $\xx$.
The eigenvalues of $A$ can be computed by solving the **characteristic equation**
$$
P(\lambda) = 0 \,, \quad P(\lambda) := \det \left(  A - \lambda I  \right)  \,,
$$
where $P$ is the **characteristic polynomial** of $A$. Finally, we recall that $A \in \R^{2 \times 2}$ is **diagonalizable** if there exists a 
diagonal matrix $D$ and an invertible matrix $P$ such that
$$
A = P^{-1} D P \,.
$$



::: {.Theorem  #theorem-weingarten-diagonal}

Let $\SSS$ be an orientable surface and let $\WW_{\pp,\SSS}$ be the 
Weingarten map at $\pp$. There exist scalars $\kappa_1, \kappa_2 \in \R$ and an orthonormal basis 
$\{\mathbf{t}_1,\mathbf{t}_2\}$ of $T_{\pp} \SSS$ such that 
$$
\WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\mathbf{t}_1) = \kappa_1 \mathbf{t}_1 \,, 
\quad \WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\mathbf{t}_2) = \kappa_2 \mathbf{t}_2 \,.
$$


:::




::: Proof

Let $\sss$ be a chart for $\SSS$ at $\pp$. Then $\{\sss_u,\sss_v\}$ is a basis of $T_{\pp} \SSS$. Let $\WW$ be 
the matrix of $\WW_{\pp,\SSS}$ with respect to such basis.
By Theorem \ref{theorem-weingarten} we have
$$
\WW = \mathscr{F}_1^{-1} \mathscr{F}_2 \,. 
$$
Recall that
$$
\mathscr{F}_1^{-1} = \frac{1}{EG - F^2 }
\left( 
\begin{array}{cc}
G & - F\\
-F & E
\end{array}
\right)  \,.
$$
Thus $\mathcal{F}_1^{-1}$ is symmetric. Since $\mathcal{F}_2$ is symmetric, and the product
of symmetric matrices is symmetric, we conclude that $\WW$ is symmetric. 
Therefore $\WW_{\pp,\SSS}$ is self-adjoint, see Remark \ref{remark-self-adoint}. The thesis now follows from the Spectral Theorem, see Theorem \ref{theorem-spectral}.

### Principal curvatures and vectors

Let $\SSS$ be an orientable surface and $\WW_{\pp,\SSS}$ be the Weingarten map of $\SSS$ at $\pp$. We define:

- The **principal curvatures** of $\SSS$ at $\pp$ are the eigenvalues $\kappa_1, \kappa_2$
of $\WW_{\pp,\SSS}$.

- The **principal vectors** corresponding to $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$ are the eigenvectors $\mathbf{t_1}, \mathbf{t}_2$.

:::


::: Remark
### Computing principal curvatures and vectors

Corollary \ref{corollary-weingarten-diagonal} gives an explicit way
to compute the principal curvatures and vectors:

1. Compute the eigenvalues of $\WW$. This is done by solving for $\kappa$ the equation
$$
\det(\WW - \kappa I) = 0 \,.
$$
This gives one of the principal curvatures 
$$
\kappa_i = \kappa
$$

2. Compute the eigenvector(s) related to the eigenvalue $\kappa$. This is 
done by finding scalars $\lambda$, $\mu$ which solve the linear system
$$
(\WW - \kappa_i I) 
\left( 
\begin{array}{c}
\lambda \\
\mu
\end{array}
\right) = 0 
$$
This gives the eigenvector of $\WW$
$$
\xx_i = (\lambda,\mu)
$$

3. The principal vector associated to $\kappa_i$ is  
$$
\mathbf{t}_i = \lambda \sss_u + \mu \sss_v 
$$


:::


::: Remark
### Computing principal curvatures and vectors

If the matrix of the Weingarten map has the form
$$
\WW = 
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
\kappa_1 & 0 \\
0        & \kappa_2
\end{array}
\right)
$$
then $\WW$ is already diagonal. The eigenvalues of $\WW$ are $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$, with eigenvectors
$$
\xx_1 = (1,0) \,, \quad 
\xx_2 = (0,1) \,. 
$$
Therefore $\kappa_1,\kappa_2$ are the principal curvatures, with 
principal vectors given by
$$
\mathbf{t}_1 = \sss_u \,, \quad \mathbf{t}_2 = \sss_v \,.
$$

:::




The principal curvatures are related to the Gaussian and mean curvatures.


::: Proposition

Let $\SSS$ be an orientable surface. Then
$$
K = \kappa_1 \kappa_2 \,, \quad H = \frac{\kappa_1 + \kappa_2}{2} \,.
$$

:::


::: Proof

By Corollary \ref{corollary-weingarten-diagonal} we have
$$
\WW = P^{-1} D P \,, \quad 
D = 
\left( 
\begin{array}{cc}
\kappa_1 & 0 \\
0        & \kappa_2
\end{array}
\right) \,.
$$
By the properties of determinant
$$
\det \left(  A B \right) = \det (A) \det (B) \,, \quad \forall \, A,B \in \R^{2 \times 2} \,.
$$
By definition of Gaussian curvature and the above formula we infer
\begin{align*}
K & = \det ( \WW ) \\
  & = \det \left( P^{-1} D P  \right) \\
  & = \det (P^{-1}) \det (D) \det (P) \\
  & = \det (D) \\
  & = \kappa_1 \kappa_2 \,,
\end{align*}
where we also used that 
$$
\det(P^{-1}) = \frac{1}{\det(P)}  \,.
$$
The trace satisfies
$$
\operatorname{trace} \left(  A B \right) = \operatorname{trace} \left( BA \right) \,, \quad \forall \, A,B \in \R^{2 \times 2} \,.
$$
By definition of mean curvature and the above formula we get
\begin{align*}
H & = \frac12 \operatorname{trace} (\WW ) \\
  & = \frac12 \operatorname{trace} \left( P^{-1} D P  \right) \\
  & = \frac12 \operatorname{trace} \left( P P^{-1} D  \right) \\
  & = \frac12 \operatorname{trace} \left( D  \right) \\
  & = \frac{1}{2} \left( \kappa_1  + \kappa_2 \right) \,,
\end{align*}
concluding the proof.

::: Important

In general $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$ are hard to compute, as they require solving a second order
equation. Instead $K$ and $H$ are easier to compute, as they are directly expressed in terms of
the first and second fundamental form coefficients.

M & =\sss_{uv} \cdot \NN  = 0 \\
N & = \sss_{vv} \cdot \NN  = 1

::: Example
### Torus

Consider a circle $\mathcal{C}$ contained in the $xz$-plane, with center 
at distance $b>0$ from the $z$-axis and radius $a$, with $0<a<b$. 
The torus is obtained by rotating $\mathcal{C}$ around the $z$-axis. 
This surface is charted by 
$$
\sss (\theta,\f) = \left( \left(a+b \cos(\theta) \right) \cos(\f), \left(a+b \cos(\theta) \right) \sin(\f), b\sin(\theta) \right) \,,
$$
where $\theta \in (-\pi/2,\pi/2)$ and $\f \in (0,2\pi)$.
One can compute that the first and second fundamental forms are
\begin{align*}
\mathscr{F}_1 & =
\left(   
\begin{array}{cc}
b^2  &    0   \\
0   & \left(a+b \cos(\theta) \right)^2 
\end{array}
\right)  \\
\mathscr{F}_2 & =
\left(   
\begin{array}{cc}
b  &    0   \\
0   & \left(a+b \cos(\theta) \right) \cos(\theta)
\end{array}
\right) \,.
\end{align*}
Therefore the matrix of the Weingarten map is
$$
\WW = \mathscr{F}_1^{-1} \mathscr{F}_2 =
\left(   
\begin{array}{cc}
\dfrac{1}{b}  &    0   \\
0   & \dfrac{\cos(\theta)}{ a + b \cos(\theta)}
\end{array}
\right) \,.
$$
Since $\WW$ is diagonal, the principal curvatures are
$$
\kappa_1 = \frac{1}{b} \,, \quad 
\kappa_2 = \dfrac{\cos(\theta)}{ a + b \cos(\theta)} \,,
$$
and the principal vectors
$$
\mathbf{t}_1 = \sss_u \,, \quad 
\mathbf{t}_2 = \sss_v \,.
$$
The Gaussian and mean curvature are
\begin{align*}
K & = \kappa_1 \kappa_2 = \dfrac{\cos(\theta)}{ b  \left(a + b \cos(\theta)\right)}  \\
H & = \frac{\kappa_1 + \kappa_2}{2} =
\dfrac{a + 2b \cos(\theta)}{2 b \left(a + b \cos(\theta)\right)}  
\end{align*}

### Normal and geodesic curvatures


Let $\SSS$ be a regular surface and consider all the curves $\g$ on $\SSS$ 
passing through the point $\pp \in \SSS$. 

::: Question

Which curves through $\pp$ have greatest or lowest curvature?

:::

We start our analysis with the following proposition.


::: {.Proposition #proposition-surface-frame}

Let $\SSS$ be a regular surface and $\g \colon (a,b) \to \SSS$ be a unit speed curve. Then 
$$
\{ \dg , \NN , \NN \times \dg  \}
$$
is an orthornormal basis of $\R^3$ for all $t \in (a,b)$, where $\NN$ is the standard unit normal to $\SSS$ evaluated at $\pp = \g(t)$.

:::

::: Proof

By definition 
$$
\dg(t) \in T_{\pp} \SSS \,, \quad \pp := \g(t) \,,
$$
for all $t \in (a,b)$. This means $\dg$ is tangent to $\SSS$. Thus
$$
\dg \cdot \NN = 0 \,.
$$
We have $\norm{\dg} = 1$ since $\g$ is unit speed. 
Moreover $\norm{\NN}=1$ by definition. 
Since $\dg$ and $\NN$ are orthogonal, we also obtain
$$
\norm{\NN \times \dg} = \norm{\NN} \norm{\dg} = 1 \,,
$$ 
by the properties of vector product. Finally 
$$
 (\NN \times \dg ) \cdot \NN  = 0 \,, \quad 
 (\NN \times \dg ) \cdot \dg  = 0 \,, \quad 
$$
by the properties of vector product.

:::



::: Important

Notice that the basis
$$
\{ \dg , \NN , \NN \times \dg  \}
$$
does not coincide with the Frenet frame of $\g$ in general.

:::



::: Proposition

Let $\SSS$ be a regular surface and $\g \colon (a,b) \to \SSS$ be a 
unit speed curve. Then
$$
\ddg = \kappa_n \NN + \kappa_g \, \left( \NN \times \dg \right) \,,
$${#eq-surface-curve-curvature}
where $\NN$ is evaluated at $\pp:=\g(t)$ and $\kappa_n,\kappa_g$ are
scalars depedent on $\pp$. Moreover
$$
\kappa_n = \ddg \cdot \NN \,, \quad \kappa_g = \ddg \cdot \left( \NN \times \dg \right)  \,,
$${#eq-surface-curve-curvature-1}
$$
\kappa^2 = \kappa_n^2 + \kappa_g^2 \,,
$${#eq-surface-curve-curvature-2}
$$
\kappa_n = \kappa \cos (\phi) \,, \quad  \kappa_g = \pm \kappa \sin(\phi) \,,
$${#eq-surface-curve-curvature-3}
where $\kappa$ is the curvature of $\g$ and $\phi$ is the angle between 
$\NN$ and $\nn$, the principal unit normal of $\g$.

:::


::: Proof


*Part 1.* By Proposition \ref{proposition-surface-frame} we know that
$$
\{ \dg , \NN , \NN \times \dg  \}
$$
is an orthornormal basis of $\R^3$. Hence 
$$
\ddg = a \dg + b \NN + c \left( \NN \times \dg \right) \,,
$$
for some coefficients $a,b,c \in \R$. Since $\g$ is unit speed, 
we have that
$$
\dg \cdot \ddg = 0 \,.
$$
On the other hand, 
$$
\dg \cdot \ddg = a  (\dg \cdot \dg ) + b ( \dg \cdot \NN ) + 
c \dg \cdot \left( \NN \times \dg \right) = a \,,
$$
since $\dg$ is orthogonal to $\NN$ and $\NN \times \dg$, and 
$$
\dg \cdot \dg  = \norm{\dg}^2 = 1 \,.
$$
Therefore $a = 0$ and 
$$
\ddg = b \NN + c \left( \NN \times \dg \right) \,.
$$
Setting $\kappa_n := b$ and $\kappa_g := c$ we conclude (@eq-surface-curve-curvature).

*Part 2.* Taking the scalar product of (@eq-surface-curve-curvature) with $\NN$ yields
$$
\ddg \cdot \NN = \kappa_n \norm{\NN}^2 + \kappa_g \left( \NN \times \dg  \right) \cdot \NN = \kappa_n \,,
$$
where we used that $\NN$ and $\NN \times \dg$ are orthonormal vectors. 
Similarly, taking the scalar product of (@eq-surface-curve-curvature) with $\NN \times \dg$ yields the second equation in (@eq-surface-curve-curvature-1).

*Part 3.* By (@eq-surface-curve-curvature) we infer
\begin{align*}
\norm{\ddg}^2 & = \kappa_n^2 \norm{\NN}^2 + 2 \kappa_n \kappa_g \NN \cdot 
\left(\NN \times \dg \right) + \kappa_g^2  \norm{\NN \times \dg}^2 \\
              & = \kappa_n^2 + \kappa_g^2 \,,
\end{align*}
where we used that $\NN$ and $\NN \times \dg$ are orthonormal. Since 
$\kappa(t) = \norm{\ddg(t)}$, we get (@eq-surface-curve-curvature-2).

*Part 4.* Recalling that 
$$
\ddg = \kappa \nn \,,
$$
from the first equation in (@eq-surface-curve-curvature-1) we obtain
\begin{align*}
\kappa_n & = \ddg \cdot \NN \\
         & = \kappa \nn \cdot \NN \\
         & = \kappa \| \nn \|^2 \| \NN \|^2 \cos(\phi) \\
         & = \kappa \cos(\phi) \,,
\end{align*}
where we used that $\nn$ and $\NN$ have unit norm. Hence the first 
equation in (@eq-surface-curve-curvature-3) is established. By 
(@eq-surface-curve-curvature-2) we get
\begin{align*}
\kappa_g^2 & = \kappa^2 - \kappa_n^2 \\
           & = \kappa^2 \cos^2(\phi) -  \kappa_n^2 \\
           & = \kappa^2 (\cos^2(\phi) - 1 ) \\
           & = \kappa^2 \sin^2(\phi) \,,
\end{align*}
from which we obtain the second equation in (@eq-surface-curve-curvature-3).

:::


The quantities $\kappa_n$ and $\kappa_g$ are the normal and geodesic 
curvatures of $\g$.


::: Definition 
### Normal and geodesic curvature

Let $\SSS$ be regular and $\g \colon (a,b) \to \SSS$ a unit speed curve. By (@eq-surface-curve-curvature) we have
$$
\ddg = \kappa_{n} \NN + \kappa_{g} (\NN \times \dg )
$$
for $\NN$ the standard unit normal to $\SSS$ and scalars 
$\kappa_n , \kappa_g \in \R$. We call

- $\kappa_{n}$ the **normal curvature** of $\g$,
- $\kappa_{g}$ the **geodesic curvature** of $\g$.

:::



The normal curvature $\kappa_n$ can be computed via the second 
fundamental form, as shown in the theorem below.


::: {.Theorem #theorem-normal-curvature}

Let $\SSS$ be a regular surface and $\g \colon (a,b) \to \SSS$ a 
unit speed curve. Denote $\pp := \g(t)$. We have:

1. The normal curvature $\kappa_n$ satisfies
$$
\kappa_n = {II}_{\pp} (\dg, \dg) \,.
$$

2. Let $\sss$ be a chart for $\SSS$ at $\pp$. Then 
$$
\g(t)=\sss(u(t), v(t))
$$ 
for some smooth functions $u,v \colon (a,b) \to \R$, and 
$$
\kappa_{n}=L \dot{u}^{2}+2 M \dot{u} \dot{v}+N \dot{v}^{2} \,.
$$

:::


::: Proof

*Part 1.* By definition we have
$$
\dg (t) \in T_{\pp} \SSS 
$$
when $\pp = \g(t)$. Set
$$
\tg(t) := \NN( \g(t)) \,.
$${#eq-theorem-normal-curvature-1}
By definition of differential we have 
$$
d_{\pp} \NN (\dg(t)) = \dtg(t)  \,.
$${#eq-theorem-normal-curvature-2}
Note that
$$
\tg(t) \cdot \dg(t) = 0 \,,
$$
since $\NN$ is normal to $\SSS$ at $\pp$ and $\dg(t) \in T_{\pp}(\SSS)$.
Differentiating the above expression we get
\begin{align*}
0 & = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \tg(t) \cdot \dg(t) \right) \\
  & = \tg(t) \cdot \ddg(t)  + \dtg(t) \cdot \dg(t)   \\
  & = \NN (\g(t)) \cdot \ddg(t)  + d_{\pp} \NN (\dg(t)) \cdot \dg(t)  
\end{align*}
where in the last equation we used (@eq-theorem-normal-curvature-1) and
(@eq-theorem-normal-curvature-2). Hence
$$
- d_{\pp} \NN (\dg(t)) \cdot \dg(t)  = 
\NN (\g(t))  \cdot  \ddg(t)   \,.
$${#eq-theorem-normal-curvature-3}
By definition of Weingarten and Gauss map we get
$$
\WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\dg(t)) = - d_{\pp} \mathcal{G} (\dg(t)) =  
- d_{\pp} \NN (\dg(t)) \,.
$${#eq-theorem-normal-curvature-4}
Therefore, using (@eq-theorem-normal-curvature-3) and (@eq-theorem-normal-curvature-4), we infer
\begin{align*}
II_{\pp} (\dg(t) , \dg(t) ) & = \WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\dg(t)) \cdot \dg(t) \\
                            & = - d_{\pp} \NN (\dg(t)) \cdot \dg(t) \\
                            & = \NN (\g(t))  \cdot  \ddg(t) \\
                            & = \kappa_n \,,
\end{align*}
where in the last equality we used (@eq-surface-curve-curvature-1).


*Part 2.* Let $\sss$ be a chart at $\pp$ and 
$$
\g(t) = \sss(u(t),v(t)) \,.
$$
Differentiating the above expression we get
$$
\dg(t) = \dot{u} \sss_u + \dot{v} \sss_v \,.
$$
By definition of $du$ and $dv$, see Definition \ref{definition-coordinate-functions}, we have
$$
du(\dg(t)) = \dot{u}(t) \,, \quad 
dv(\dg(t)) = \dot{v}(t) \,.
$$
Therefore, using Part 1 and Theorem \ref{theorem-sff-chart}, we obtain
\begin{align*}
\kappa_n & = II_{\pp} (\dg(t) , \dg(t) ) \\
         & = L du(\dg(t))^2 + 2M du(\dg(t)) dv(\dg(t)) + N dv(\dg(t))^2 \\ 
         & = L \dot{u}^{2}+2 M \dot{u} \dot{v}+N \dot{v}^{2} \,.

Show that 
$$
\kappa_{n}(t)=1
$$ 
for all unit speed curves on the sphere.

*Solution.* 
We have computed in Example \ref{example-sphere-principal} that the 
second fundamental form of $\sss$ is
$$
\mathcal{F}_2 = \sin^{2}(v) du^2 + dv^2 
$$
Let $\g$ be a unit speed curve on the sphere, that is,

\dg(t) & = \frac{d}{dt} ( \cos(u(t)) \sin(v(t)), \sin(u(t)) \sin(v(t)), \cos(v(t)) ) \\

  & \qquad \dot{v} \sin (u) \cos (v),-\dot{v} \sin (v))
\end{align*}
so that 
$$
\| \dg(t) \|^2 =  \sin^{2}(v) \dot{u}^{2}+\dot{v}^{2} \,.
$$
Since $\g$ is unit speed, we also get
$$ 
\|\dg\|^{2} = 1 \,,

showing that 
$$
\kappa_{n}=\sin^{2}(v) \dot{u}^{2}+\dot{v}^{2} = 1 \,,

as required.

The normal curvature $\kappa_n$ is related to the principal 
curvatures $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$.



::: Theorem
### Euler's Theorem {#theorem-euler-thm}

Let $\SSS$ be a regular surface and denote by $\kappa_1, \kappa_2$ the
principal curvatures with principal vectors $\mathbf{t}_1,\mathbf{t}_2$.
Let $\g$ be a unit speed curve on $\SSS$. The normal curvature of $\g$ is given by
$$
\kappa_n = \kappa_1 \cos^2(\theta) + \kappa_2 \sin^2(\theta) \,,
$$
where $\theta$ is the angle between $\dg$ and $\mathbf{t}_1$.

:::


::: Proof

Let $\g$ be a unit speed curve on $\SSS$ and set
$$
\pp := \g(t) \,.
$$
By Theorem \ref{theorem-weingarten-diagonal} the principal vectors 
$\{ \mathbf{t}_1, \mathbf{t}_2 \}$ form an orthonormal basis of 
$T_{\pp} \SSS$. Since by definition
$$ 
\dg(t) \in T_{\pp} \SSS \,,
$$
there exist scalars $\lambda,\mu \in \R$ such that
$$
\dg(t) = \lambda \mathbf{t}_1 + \mu \mathbf{t}_2 \,.
$$
As $\g$ is unit speed and $\mathbf{t}_1, \mathbf{t}_2$ orthonormal, we infer
$$
1 = \norm{\dg(t)}^2 = \dg \cdot \dg = \lambda^2 + \mu^2 \,.
$$
Therefore there exists $\theta \in [0,2\pi]$ such that 
$$
\lambda = \cos(\theta), \quad 
\mu = \sin(\theta) \,.
$$
Hence 
$$
\dg(t) = \cos(\theta) \mathbf{t}_1 + \sin(\theta) \mathbf{t}_2 \,.
$${#eq-euler-thm-proof}
In particular, we can take the scalar product of (@eq-euler-thm-proof) with
$\mathbf{t}_1$ to get
$$
\cos(\theta) = \lambda = \dg(t) \cdot \mathbf{t}_1 \,.
$$
Since $\dg$ and $\mathbf{t}_1$ are unit vectors, from the above equation we conclude that 
$\theta$ is the angle between $\dg$ and $\mathbf{t}_1$. In addition, recall
that
$$
\WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\mathbf{t}_1) = \kappa_1 \mathbf{t}_1 \,, \quad 
\WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\mathbf{t}_2) = \kappa_2 \mathbf{t}_2 \,, 
$$
and $\mathbf{t}_1$, $\mathbf{t}_2$ are orthonormal. Thus
\begin{align*}
II_{\pp}(\mathbf{t}_1 , \mathbf{t}_1) & = \WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\mathbf{t}_1) \cdot \mathbf{t}_1 = \kappa_1 \norm{\mathbf{t}_1}^2 = \kappa_1 \\
II_{\pp}(\mathbf{t}_1 , \mathbf{t}_2) & = \WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\mathbf{t}_1) \cdot \mathbf{t}_2 = \kappa_1  \mathbf{t}_1 \cdot \mathbf{t}_2 = 0 \\
II_{\pp}(\mathbf{t}_2 , \mathbf{t}_1) & = \WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\mathbf{t}_2) \cdot \mathbf{t}_1 = \kappa_2  \mathbf{t}_2 \cdot \mathbf{t}_1 = 0 \\
II_{\pp}(\mathbf{t}_2 , \mathbf{t}_2) & = \WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\mathbf{t}_2) \cdot \mathbf{t}_2 = \kappa_2 \norm{\mathbf{t}_2}^2 = \kappa_2 \\
\end{align*}
By Theorem \ref{theorem-normal-curvature}, equation (@eq-euler-thm-proof), and bilinearity of $II_{\pp}$, we get
\begin{align*}
\kappa_n & = {II}_{\pp} (\dg,\dg) \\
& = \cos^2(\theta) \, II_{\pp}(\mathbf{t}_1 , \mathbf{t}_1)  +  \cos(\theta) \sin(\theta) \,  II_{\pp}(\mathbf{t}_1 , \mathbf{t}_2) \\ 
& \,\,\,\, + \sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)  \,  II_{\pp}(\mathbf{t}_2 , \mathbf{t}_1)  + \sin^2(\theta)  \,  II_{\pp}(\mathbf{t}_2 , \mathbf{t}_2)  \\
& = \cos^2(\theta) \kappa_1 + \sin^2(\theta) \kappa_2 
\end{align*}
ending the proof.

As an immediate corollary of the Euler's Theorem we get the next
statement.


::: {.Corollary #corollary-euler-thm}

Let $\SSS$ be a regular surface and $\kappa_1, \kappa_2$ its
principal curvatures at $\pp$ with principal vectors $\mathbf{t}_1,\mathbf{t}_2$. Then:

- $\kappa_{1}$ and $\kappa_{2}$ are the minimum and maximum values of $\kappa_{n}$, for all unit speed curves on $\SSS$ passing through $\pp$.

- The directions of lowest and highest curvature on $\SSS$ are given by $\mathbf{t}_1$ and $\mathbf{t}_2$.

In Example \ref{example-curves-on-sphere} we have shown with a direct

$$
\kappa_n = 1
$$
for all unit speed curves on the sphere. Thanks to Euler's Theorem we

## Local shape of a surface



The principal curvatures $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$ determine
the maximum and minimum curvature of a surface $\SSS$, see
Corollary \ref{corollary-euler-thm}. Hence we can study the local
shape of $\SSS$ in function of $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$. 




::: Theorem
### Local structure of surfaces {#theorem-local-surface}

Let $\SSS$ be a regular surface and $\pp \in \SSS$. In the vicinity of $\pp$ 
the surface $\SSS$ is approximated by the quadric surface of equation
$$
z = \frac12 \left( x^2 \kappa_1 (\pp) + y^2 \kappa_2(\pp) \right) \,,
$${#eq-local-structure}
where $\kappa_1 (\pp),\kappa_2 (\pp)$ are the principal curvatures of
$\SSS$ at $\pp$.

:::


::: Proof

By Theorem \ref{theorem-weingarten-diagonal} the principal vectors 
$\{ \mathbf{t}_1, \mathbf{t}_2 \}$ are an orthonormal basis of 
$T_{\pp} \SSS$. Therefore the standard unit normal $\NN$ at $\pp$ is 
orthogonal to both 
$\mathbf{t}_1$ and $\mathbf{t}_2$. Up to rotations and translations, 
we can assume WLOG that $\pp = \zero$ and
$$
\mathbf{t}_1 = (1,0,0) \,, \quad 
\mathbf{t}_2 = (0,1,0) \,, \quad 
\NN = (0,0,1) \,.
$${#eq-theorem-local-surface}
Let $\sss$ be a chart for $\SSS$ at $\pp$. Up to reparametrizing, 
we can assume that
$$
\sss(0,0)  = \pp = \zero \,.
$$
As $\NN = (0,0,1)$, it follows that $T_{\pp} \SSS$ is the $xy$-plane
$$
T_{\pp} \SSS = \R^2 = \{ (x,y,0) \divider x, y \in \R \} \, .
$$
Since $\{\sss_u ,\sss_v\}$ is a basis for $T_{\pp} \SSS$, we have that 
for each $(x,y) \in \R^2$ there exist $(s,t) \in \R^2$ such that
$$
(x,y,0) = s \sss_u + t \sss_v \,,
$${#eq-theorem-local-surface-1}
where $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ are evaluated at $(0,0)$. The Taylor 
approximation of $\sss$ at $(0,0)$ is
\begin{align*}
\sss(s,t) & = \sss(0,0) + s \sss_u + t \sss_v \\
          & \qquad + \frac12 \left(  s^2 \sss_{uu} + 2st \sss_{uv} + t^2 \sss_{vv}   \right) + R \,, \\
          & = (x,y,0) + \frac12 \left(  s^2 \sss_{uu} + 2st \sss_{uv} + t^2 \sss_{vv}   \right) + R
\end{align*}
where $R$ is a remainder and the derivatives of $\sss$ are evaluated
at $(0,0)$. Hence, if $x,y$ are small (and thus $s,t$ are small), we have
that
$$
\sss(s,t) \approx  (x,y,z)
$$
where
\begin{align*} 
z & := \frac12 \left(  s^2 \sss_{uu} + 2st \sss_{uv} + t^2 \sss_{vv}   \right) \cdot \NN  \\
  & = \frac12 \left( L s^2  + 2M st + N t^2   \right) \,,
\end{align*}
with $L,M,N$ coefficients of the second fundamental form of $\sss$ at
$(0,0)$. Set 
$$
\vv :=  s \sss_u + t \sss_v  \,.
$$
By Theorem \ref{theorem-sff-chart} we have
$$
 L s^2  + 2M st + N t^2  = II_{\pp} (\vv,\vv) = \WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\vv) \cdot \vv \,.
$$
On the other hand, using (@eq-theorem-local-surface) and
(@eq-theorem-local-surface-1) we get
$$
\vv = s \sss_u + t \sss_v  = (x,y,0) = x \mathbf{t}_1 + y \mathbf{t}_2 \,.
$$
Since the Weingarten map is linear we get
\begin{align*}
 \WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\vv) & = x  \WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\mathbf{t}_1) + y  \WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\mathbf{t}_2) \\
    & = x \kappa_1 \mathbf{t}_1 + y \kappa_2 \mathbf{t}_2 \,, 
\end{align*}
where we used that $\mathbf{t}_1$ and $\mathbf{t}_2$ are eigenvectors of 
$\WW_{\pp,\SSS}$ with eigenvalues $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$. Hence
\begin{align*}
 \WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\vv) \cdot \vv & =  x \kappa_1 \mathbf{t}_1 + y \kappa_2 \mathbf{t}_2 \cdot ( x \mathbf{t}_1 + y  \mathbf{t}_2) \\
                               & = x^2 \kappa_1 + y^2 \kappa_2  
\end{align*}
Therefore
\begin{align*}
z & = \frac12 \left( L s^2  + 2M st + N t^2   \right) \\
  & = \frac12 \WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\vv) \cdot \vv \\
  & = \frac12 \left( x^2 \kappa_1 + y^2 \kappa_2  \right) \,,
\end{align*}
showing that 
$$
\sss(t,s) \approx \left(x,y, \frac12 \left( x^2 \kappa_1 + y^2 \kappa_2  \right)  \right) \,.
$$

A surface $\SSS$ is locally approximated by one of the above quadrics, depending on the values of principal curvatures at $\pp$.

:::



::: Example

Consider the surface chart
$$
\sss (u, v) = \left(u-v, u+v, u^{2}+v^{2}\right) \,.
$$
Show that $\pp = \sss(1,0)$ is an elliptic point. Therefore $\sss$ is approximated by an *elliptic paraboiloid* in the vicinity of $\pp$.

*Solution.* In Example \ref{example-weingarten-2} we have shown that the Weingarten matrix of $\sss$ is
$$
\WW 
 = 
\frac{1}{(1 + 2u^2 + 2v^2)^{\frac32}}
\,\left(\begin{array}{ll}
1 + 2v^2 & -2uv \\
- 2uv & 1 + 2u^2
\end{array}\right) \,.
$$
For $u=1$ and $v=1$ we obtain
$$
\WW 
 = 
\frac{1}{3^{\frac32}}
\,\left(\begin{array}{ll}
1  & 0 \\
0 &  3
\end{array}\right)
=
\left(\begin{array}{ll}
3^{-\frac32}  & 0 \\
0 &  3^{- \frac12}
\end{array}\right) \,.
$$
Therefore the principal curvatures at $\pp$ are
$$
\kappa_1(\pp) = 3^{-\frac32} \,, \quad
\kappa_2(\pp) = 3^{-\frac12} \,. \quad
$$
Since $\kappa_1(\pp) > 0$ and $\kappa_2(\pp) > 0$ we have that $\pp$ is an elliptic point.

### Umbilical points


::: Definition
### Umbilical point

Let $\SSS$ be a regular surface and denote by $\kappa_1(\pp)$ and 
$\kappa_2(\pp)$ its principal curvatures at $\pp$. We say that $\pp$ is an **umbilic** if 
$$
\kappa_{1}(\mathbf{p})=\kappa_{2}(\mathbf{p}) \,.
$$

:::


::: Remark

Umbilical points might be **planar** or **elliptic**.

:::


Suppose that $\pp$ is an umbilic, that is, 
$$
\kappa_1=\kappa_2 
$$
at $\pp$. Let $\kappa_n$ be the normal curvature of a unit speed
curve $\g$ passing through $\pp$. By Theorem \ref{theorem-euler-thm}
we have
$$
\kappa_n = \kappa_1 \cos^2(\theta) + \kappa_2 \sin^2(\theta) = \kappa_1 \,.
$$
Therefore $\kappa_n$ does not depend on $\g$. Intuitively, this 
can only happen if in the vicinity of $\pp$ the surface looks like
a sphere or a plane. Indeed, the following theorem holds.


::: Theorem

Let $\SSS$ be a regular surface such that every point $\pp \in \SSS$ is
umbilic. Then $\SSS$ is an open subset of plane or a sphere.

:::


::: Proof

By assumption we have
$$
\kappa_1 (\pp) = \kappa_2 (\pp) = \kappa (\pp) \,, \quad \forall \, \pp \in \SSS \,.
$${#eq-theorem-umbilic}


*Step 1. $\kappa$ is constant.*

By Theorem \ref{theorem-weingarten-diagonal} the principal vectors
$\{\mathbf{t}_1,\mathbf{t}_2\}$ are an orthonormal basis of
$T_{\pp} \SSS$. Hence, for each $\vv \in T_{\pp} \SSS$ there exist
$\lambda,\mu \in \R$ such that
$$
\vv = \lambda \mathbf{t}_1 + \mu \mathbf{t}_2 \,.
$$
Using the linearity of $\WW_{\pp,\SSS}$ and (@eq-theorem-umbilic)
we obtain
\begin{align*}
\WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\vv) & = \lambda \WW_{\pp,\SSS} ( \mathbf{t}_1) + \mu  \WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\mathbf{t}_2) \\
                     & = \lambda \kappa \mathbf{t}_1 + \mu \kappa \mathbf{t}_2 \\
                     & = \kappa \vv \,,
\end{align*}
showing that
$$
\WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\vv) = \kappa \vv \,, \quad \forall \, \vv \in T_{\pp} \SSS \,.
$${#eq-theorem-umbilic-1}
Let $\sss \colon U \to \R^3$ be a chart of $\SSS$. Up to restricting $\sss$, we can
assume that $U$ is connected. By Lemma \ref{lemma-weingarten} we have
$$
\WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\sss_u) = - \NN_{u} \,, \quad 
\WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\sss_v) = - \NN_{v} \,.
$$
On the other hand, by (@eq-theorem-umbilic-1) we infer
$$
\WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\sss_u) = \kappa \sss_u \,, \quad 
\WW_{\pp,\SSS} (\sss_v) = \kappa \sss_v \,,
$$
from which 
$$
\NN_{u} = - \kappa \sss_u \,, \quad 
\NN_{v} = - \kappa \sss_v \,.
$${#eq-theorem-umbilic-2}
Thus
$$
\left( \kappa \sss_u \right)_v = - \left( \NN_u \right)_v = 
- \left( \NN_v \right)_u = \left( \kappa \sss_v \right)_u \,.
$$
Moreover
\begin{align*}
\left( \kappa \sss_u \right)_v & = \kappa_v \sss_u + \kappa \sss_{uv} \\
\left( \kappa \sss_v \right)_u & = \kappa_u \sss_v + \kappa \sss_{uv} \,,
\end{align*}
so that 
$$
\kappa_v \sss_u = \kappa_u \sss_v \,.
$${#eq-theorem-umbilic-3}
Recall that $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ are linearly independent, being $\SSS$ regular. Hence the linear combination at (@eq-theorem-umbilic-3) must be trivial, implying
$$
\kappa_u = \kappa_v = 0 \,.
$$
Since $U$ is connected, the above implies that $\kappa$ is constant.


*Step 2.* We have the two cases $\kappa = 0$ and $\kappa \neq 0$.

- Assume $\kappa = 0$. By (@eq-theorem-umbilic-2) we get that
$$
\NN_u = \NN_v = \zero \,,
$$
which implies $\NN$ is constant. Therefore 
$$
\left( \NN \cdot \sss  \right)_u = \NN_u \cdot \sss + \NN \cdot \sss_u = 0  
$$
since $\NN_u = \zero$ and $\NN \cdot \sss_u = 0$ because $\NN$ is orthogonal to $T_{\pp} \SSS$.
Similarly we get
$$
\left( \NN \cdot \sss  \right)_v = 0 \,,
$$
showing that $\NN \cdot \sss$ is constant. Hence there exists $c \in \R$ such that
$$
\NN \cdot \sss(u,v) = c \,, \quad \forall \, (u,v) \in U \,.
$$
This shows $\sss(U)$ is contained in the plane
$$
\pi = \{ \xx \in \R^3 \divider  \NN \cdot \xx = c \} \,.
$$

- Assume $\kappa \neq 0$. Condition (@eq-theorem-umbilic-2) implies 
$$
\NN = -\kappa \sss + \mathbf{a}
$$
for some $\mathbf{a} \in \R^3$ constant vector. Thus
$$
\left\|  \sss - \frac{1}{\kappa} \mathbf{a}  \right\|^2 = 
\left\| - \frac{1}{\kappa}  \NN  \right\|^2 = \frac{1}{\kappa^2} \,,
$$
given that $\| \NN \| = 1$. Therefore $\sss(U)$ is contained in the sphere of center 
$\mathbf{a}/\kappa$ and radius $1/\kappa$.
